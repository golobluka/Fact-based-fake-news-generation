## Code content

The main code is in folder `src` and is separated into three main tasks:

1. fact_extraction and manipulation of facts
2. topic generation
3. labelling

Every file contains more versions of the same function. Because the working of some functions is complicated I included detailed docstring.

## Testing code

In the notebook `testing_working`, a way to test if the code is working properly on your computer. This is valuable for debugging.

## Execution


Execution is done from notebooks in this main folder. I separated generation and labelling in different notebooks.
