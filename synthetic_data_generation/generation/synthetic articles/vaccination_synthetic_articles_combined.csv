Mitochondrion Application Biomedicine Inc. (MitoBioMed or MAB) is a global emerging regenerative medicine leader based on mitochondrial medical technology application solutions. MitoBioMed holds more than 17 international patents, develops R&D and engineering application technology platforms, and operates bases in Taiwan, Beijing, Shenzhen, Hong Kong and other places.

With the advent of an aging society, many studies in the past ten years have shown that mitochondria are closely related to aging and degenerative diseases (such as neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, etc). This is because when mitochondrial function is abnormal, it will trigger a lack of energy supply and oxidative stress, and even induce cells to enter apoptosis or autophagy, which will cause disease.

However, the ability of mitochondria to produce energy for the cell is decreased due to the presence of damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria in macrophages. Mitochondria contribute to phagocytosis, but only after they have been damaged or dysfunctional for a certain period of time. The energy produced by ATP is reduced by a factor of 0.5 times with the concentration of the composition being 50μg/ml, 50μg/ml and 5 μg / ml respectively. Intracellular activity of mitochondria was significantly decreased due to increased free radical leakage.

The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a large-scale outbreak. The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to the SARS outbreak in 2002 because the viruses have high genetic similarity. During the infection, SARS-CoV-2 represses the repair function and defense ability of lung macrophages, causes severe respiratory symptoms and acute lung damage, and even immediately causes death of infected patients.

COVID-19 and its First Line of Defense - Macrophages

Lung macrophages are important immune cells that protect against foreign pathogens when the lungs face bacteria and virus infection by using phagocytosis. Therefore, lung macrophages digest, degrade and remove these foreign objects and further activate the adaptive immune system to fight against unknown infection. Mitochondria are a major contributors to phagocytosis when macrophages remove the virus invasion. Mitochondria provide energy for the macrophage to increase their viability and produce reactive oxygen species to kill the virus. If the mitochondria in macrophage are damaged or cannot function normally, it will be insufficient to defend against the invasion of foreign viruses. Therefore, it is an important issue to maintaining immune system by keeping mitochondrial function when virus infection.

What does the Latest Research say about Mitochondrial Programs for Macrophage Support?

Originally, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was identified as atypical pneumonia from China in late 2002. This highly contagious respiratory disease, with an 8 to 15% death rate, rapidly spread to other countries within Asia and to other continents, causing devastating social, economic, and medical impact worldwide. The causative agent of SARS has been, after intense research, identified as a novel coronavirus (CoV), designated SARS-CoV. The transmission of this deadly virus is thought to be mediated through virus-laden droplets but also via either small-particle aerosol or fecal-oral routes, with the lungs as its main pathological target.

IL-6 and IL-8 are critical SARS-CoV-induced Calu-3 cell cytokines responsible, in part, for inhibiting the ability of DC to prime naïve T cells. Aliquots of DC were incubated with M-10 medium alone in the presence of control Ab and specific neutralizing Abs against IL-6, IL-8, or IP-10. Additionally, they were incubated with appropriate doses of recombinant IL-6, recombinant IL-8, or recombinant IP-10. After cultivation for 3 days, DC were harvested to assess the proliferation of naïve T cells in a standard MLR. One-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni's multiple-comparison test was used to determine the level of statistical significance. Data presented are collected from at minimum two independent experiments.

Dynamito® - Improved Mitochondrial Protection of Macrophages

Mitochondrion Applied Technology Co. Ltd. have discovered a beneficial ingredient for mitochondrial activation, screened form dozens of unique chinese medicinal materials in Taiwan. Dynamito MAPEs®, is a mitochondrial activation factor, extracted from these natural herbs by using our patented technology that has been granted many efficacy patents, approved from Taiwan, the USA, Japan, China and many other countries. Studies have demonstrate that Dynamito MAPEs ® can activate and protect the macrophages mitochondria, helping macrophages to establish the first line of defense when the human body against foreign unknown viruses (such as new coronaviruses and new influenza viruses) to avoid further lung damage, and improve macrophage function as well as body protection.

Specifically, antioxidant aim is to reduce the free radicals on the body tissue attack caused by injury or disease. Researchers used single plant extracts to conduct antioxidant testing, and the compounding of plant extracts; when compared to the composite plant extracts, it was found that the antioxidant capacity increased significantly. The cytoplasmic function of the cells was not destroyed by the hydrogen peroxide, and when compared to the control group the concentration of phyllanthus emblica, red polyphenol and green tea polyphenol in the compositions of the present invention were 50μg/ml, 50μg/ml and 5 μg/ml, respectively, the base energy of cytoskeletal cells increased by 1.13 fold when the concentration of the composition was 50μg/ml, 50μg/ml and 5 μg / ml, respectively, the energy produced by ATP increased by a factor of 1.6 times; and the energy used to cope with the stress was increased by 2.7times, energy per unit of linear body increased by 1.3 times, and the energy efficiency of oxygen consumption increased by 1.4 times. In addition, the occurrence of free radical leakage was also reduced by 44.3%.

Experiments clearly show that the free radicals involved in the energy production of the cells are effectively neutralized by many of the free radicals of our complexed plant extracts, and this action defends part of the free attack on body tissues. The intracellular activity of mitochondria was significantly enhanced, as well as increasing the number of stem cells.

0,"The FDA's review process for COVID-19 tests has come under scrutiny, particularly in the case of Thermo Fisher's TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit. Despite receiving an application within a relatively short period, the agency took a whopping 48 hours to review it and ultimately rejected it due to concerns over its accuracy.

However, the authorization was given during a public health emergency, which was first declared on January 31, 2020. The test is designed to take up to 12 hours to detect SARS-CoVp2 virus, but the FDA had doubts about its effectiveness.

FDA authorizations for the tests allow them to be used in clinics without full agency approval, but only if they meet certain quality control standards.

Diagnostic's Qiagen has had funding withheld by BARDA due to concerns over its accuracy. Despite this, Qiagen has scaled up production by 70% to respond to COVID-19 and developed a new test kit that may be able to accurately distinguish COVID-19 from some other respiratory infections.

The CDC has also updated their guidance which will increase the demand for testing; criteria now also includes healthcare personnel or any person that has had direct contact with an infected person in the 2 weeks since displaying symptoms and anyone who has been within 6 feet of an infected person for a prolonged period of time.

Diagnostic’s Qiagen, which is Thermo Fisher’s latest acquisition has received funding boosts from the American government to develop its own coronavirus test. BARDA provided Qiagen with $598,000 to accelerate development of its cartridge based QIAstat-Dx test kit, but the company may not be able to accurately distinguish COVID-19 from all other respiratory infections.

Thermo Fisher granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by FDA for TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit within 24 hours of application. The company says the test is designed to detect specific nucleic acids from the SARS-CoVp2 virus to provide results within just 4 hours including the time required to prepare the sample and conduct analysis.

'The authorization of our diagnostic test for COVID-19 will help to protect patients and enable medical staff to respond swiftly to treat those who are ill and prevent the spread of infection,' said Thermo Fisher’s chairman, president and CEO, Marc Casper. “In partnership with the FDA and regulatory authorities around the world, we are committed to expanding the availability of diagnostic testing to prevent the spread of this disease.""","{

According to the FDA both tests were given the green light within 24 hours of receiving their applications, this allows for immediate use of Thermo Fischer’s TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit on its Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx real time hardware within certain laboratories across America.

The company says the test is designed to detect the specific nucleic acids from the SARS-CoVp2 virus to provide results within just 4 hours including the time required to prepare the sample and conduct analysis.

“We have scaled up production to respond to the rapid spread of COVID-19, moving to 24-hour, seven-day-a-week operations at two key sites, investing to expand capacity by 70% and adding staff,” said interim CEO Thierry Bernard, who also heads the company’s molecular diagnostics business area.

“Our top priority is producing the QIAamp and EZ1 sample technologies recommended in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control guidelines for testing, as well as the new QIAstat-Dx cartridges,” Bernard said. “We are working closely with laboratories, hospitals and other customers around the world to assess their flexibility, timing and quantity needs.”","{

}","Tesla will temporarily shut down its car manufacturing plant in Fremont, California, starting at the end of Monday, March 23rd, joining nearly every other major automaker in suspending its US operations due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. The announcement comes after days of back-and-forth with the local authorities about whether the company was exempt from a recent shelter-in-place order in the San Francisco Bay Area. Tesla will also suspend most operations at its solar panel factory in Buffalo, New York.

“Despite taking all known health precautions, continued operations in certain locations has caused challenges for our employees, their families and our suppliers,” the company wrote in a press release. “As such, we have decided to temporarily suspend production” at both factories.

Hourly employees at both factories will “continue to receive their normal pay through Monday, after which point we will provide paid leave during suspended operations,” according to an email from the company’s regional HR boss Valerie Workman viewed by The Verge. “Those who have been working from home should continue to do so and consider it business as usual. We understand you will have many questions and we will be providing you with additional resources in the coming hours and days,” Workman wrote.

Tesla says it will keep some “basic operations” up and running, like work on its charging infrastructure. The company’s Gigafactory in Nevada will continue as normal, despite a recent initiative from the state’s governor asking all nonessential businesses to close.

Tesla will do “touchless deliveries” moving forward

Tesla will keep making vehicle deliveries during the shutdown. The company says it is leveraging its app and its cars’ smartphone connectivity to implement “touchless deliveries” in “many locations” to help mitigate any spread of the virus. With the touchless deliveries, “customers are able to unlock their new cars at a delivery parking lot via the Tesla App, sign any remaining relevant paperwork that has been placed in their car, and return that paperwork to an on-site drop-off location prior to leaving,” the company says.

The leaders of six counties across the San Francisco Bay Area announced the shelter-in-place order on Monday, and as part of it, told all “nonessential businesses” to close down. But Tesla kept its car factory open, despite not seeming to fit the order’s definition of an “essential business.”

Late Tuesday evening, the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office announced that it believed Tesla was “not an essential business,” and said the company should scale back to the most basic operations, like payroll. Tesla’s factory remained open, though.

Workman told employees that it was because the company had been told it was considered “national critical infrastructure” by the Department of Homeland Security, though the government agency has not responded to multiple requests to confirm this. Guidance issued by its Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency on Thursday did not list automotive manufacturing among a list of “critical infrastructure.”

On Thursday, the local police department tweeted that the police chief and members of the city’s management team was scheduled too meet with “Tesla Factory management” to “discuss cooperation for compliance with the County Health Officer’s Order.” Just a few hours later, Tesla announced the factory closure.

Tesla said Thursday that it believes the $6.3 billion in cash it had at the end of 2019, as well as the $2.3 billion it raised in February, will be “sufficient to successfully navigate an extended period of uncertainty.”

Two employees at the California factory have told The Verge things already felt pretty uncertain this week as Tesla negotiated the immediate fate of the factory with local authorities. One shared screenshots of messages from coworkers who were worried they were feeling symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, but felt they had no way to get tested.","{

}","Is it safe for me to go outside?

For most people, absolutely, experts say. The outdoors may preserve your sanity — and save social distancing.

“If we don’t encourage people to get outside, we will have a widespread social insurrection,” said Jeanne Marrazzo, director of the division of infectious diseases at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. “People are already challenged by the isolation imposed by social distancing.”



Experts say that if you maintain a six-foot distance from other people, you should be even safer outside than in a closed area.



When outdoors, “you don’t have to stay six feet away from your spouse or child,” said Maria Raven, chief of emergency medicine at the University of California at San Francisco. “But if you are meeting a friend for a hike or going to the grocery store, keep your distance.”

Dog walking is a good activity — as long as you don’t let your pet get too close to other dogs or other people. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says there is no indication pets play a significant role in transmitting the virus, it recommends you treat them like family members, keeping them away from animals and people not in your household. Duke University researchers recently reported that Winston, a pug in North Carolina, tested positive for the virus — the first reported canine case in the United States. But the results still need to be confirmed.



If you are a senior citizen or someone who is chronically ill or has a suppressed immune system, see if you can get prescriptions and groceries delivered, or send a younger relative to pick them up.



If I’m older, do I have to stay inside all the time?

It’s hard to generalize, Marrazzo said, because “some 70-year-olds run marathons, so you can’t make a blanket statement about people’s risks.” But conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease and diabetes raise people’s risks of becoming severely ill or dying of covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. And even healthy seniors, she said, “don’t get a complete pass” on increased risk. The bottom line: All seniors should take extra care.



What about masks? Should I wear one?

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that face coverings be worn in public places to slow spread of the virus, a reversal of previous recommendations.

The CDC’s website says the agency recommends the coverings for “public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g. grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.”



Some businesses do not allow customers to enter without wearing masks.

The recommendation was announced in early April by President Trump, who stressed that the guidance was voluntary and said he wasn’t planning to wear a mask. The guidance was issued after a vigorous debate within the administration. Some officials wanted the recommendation targeted primarily to locales that are being especially affected by the virus.



But health officials argued that universal masking was necessary, pointing to new data showing that a high proportion of infected people may not exhibit symptoms, even as they spread the virus by emitting droplets when they talk, sneeze or even exhale. A mask — or some kind of cloth face covering, such as a bandanna or scarf — keeps those people from infecting others, they say.



Health officials made clear that the public should avoid using the kind of gear — N95 respirators or surgical masks — that is in short supply and desperately needed by health workers.

What do I do if my significant other gets sick?

It depends. If you have been with the person day and night for several days, you may already be exposed. Still, you can’t know for sure, and doctors say it’s wise to err on the side of caution and distance yourself as much as possible.



Most cases of covid-19 have mild or moderate symptoms, and a spouse probably will be able to take care of himself or herself. If possible, the ill spouse should move into an extra bedroom, use a different bathroom and wear a mask to protect others in the household.

If you are living with someone who needs help, you should wear a mask and gloves while providing care. If you are removing a dinner plate, for example, grab it with a dishrag or wear gloves, doctors say.



Even at a distance, however, it’s important to monitor a person with covid-19. Doctors are finding that covid-19 can apparently raise the risks of blood clots, strokes and other serious conditions that require immediate medical care.



What are the symptoms of covid-19?

A few months into the crisis, we know the disease has a far wider range of symptoms than initially thought. In addition to fever, coughing, shortness of breath and other flu-like symptoms, doctors are seeing gastrointestinal problems — nausea and vomiting, for example — chest pain and a loss of smell. Some doctors report brain inflammation and pinkeye in patients. It’s not clear, physicians say, whether the varied symptoms are caused by covid-19 or just occurring at the same time.

The CDC recently added several new symptoms to its list for the coronavirus, including chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat and loss of taste and smell. The symptoms could appear two to 14 days after infection, the agency said.





What do I do if I think I’m infected?

Consult your primary care doctor, if you have one. Don’t go to the physician’s office or the emergency room without calling ahead. The coronavirus is highly contagious, and doctors want to protect themselves and other patients from infection. You’ll probably be advised to self-quarantine and, because there is no effective treatment for the disease, take over-the-counter pain medicines such as Tylenol.

If symptoms worsen, and you have trouble breathing or have underlying medical conditions, seek immediate medical care.

Will I be tested for the virus?

It depends on where you live and even what hospital or health system you use. After a sluggish start, diagnostic testing is ramping up in many parts of the country, helped by the entry of commercial labs and the approval of rapid tests by the Food and Drug Administration.





But in some states, laboratories are still overwhelmed by the demand and struggling with shortages of critical items, including chemical components needed to run the tests.

Governors, congressional leaders and public health officials have pressed for a robust testing plan from the federal government, insisting that frequent and widespread testing is crucial to ending the stay-at-home orders that have idled businesses in much of the country. But a “blueprint” presented Monday by Trump leaves the onus on states to develop their own plans and rapid-response programs.

The United States has run more tests than any other country but trails many nations in per capita testing.

What about home tests?

The FDA has not approved any tests in which the entire process — collection of nasal specimen, followed by processing and result — occur at home. But it did give emergency authorization for a test that allows patients to collect nasal samples at home. The idea is for consumers to go online and fill out a questionnaire with LabCorp, a North Carolina company. If they meet CDC guidelines for testing, they’ll be sent the Pixel kit that includes swabs and saline. Once patients collect the specimens, they can mail them to a LabCorp lab for processing.



LabCorp said it would initially make the test available only to health-care workers and emergency workers showing covid-19 symptoms. The company plans to make the test available to consumers in coming weeks. Allowing people to self-swab reduces the risk of transmitting the virus to others and the need for personal protective equipment, because health-care providers are not involved in sample collection, the company said.

What about antibody tests?

One of the hottest topics now is serology tests, designed to detect whether you have been exposed to the virus and have antibodies that may help show whether you have immunity to the illness. They are not designed to detect active infections.

Dozens of antibody tests are on the market, but the FDA has authorized fewer than 10. The agency has taken a hands-off approach, allowing companies to sell the test after notifying the FDA and saying the tests have been validated. At the same time, the agency and testing experts have warned that some of the tests are being marketed fraudulently and are of dubious quality. The government is trying to validate the unvetted tests, but it is unclear when the data will be available.

Even authorized tests have come in for scrutiny. Some government and business officials tout them as a way to reopen the economy by identifying people who can safely return to work. But many scientists, as well as the World Health Organization, say evidence is lacking that even high-quality antibody tests can prove someone who was infected has immunity from the novel coronavirus and is not at risk of being reinfected.

When will this end?

No one knows, though experts say the social distancing practiced by many Americans has prevented the pandemic from being worse. It isn’t clear how the arrival of summer’s warmer weather will affect the virus.

The White House is finalizing expanded guidelines to allow the phased reopening of schools and camps, child-care programs, certain workplaces, houses of worship, restaurants and mass transit, according to documents under review by administration officials.

Several states are lifting, or considering lifting, strict stay-at-home orders to allow some businesses to reopen. Colorado, Georgia and Texas are among those pressing ahead. Even New York, which was hit especially hard, is exploring a loosening of the rules. But public health officials warn state leaders to proceed carefully and to be prepared to reinstate tough regulations if the number of virus cases surges. Experts say any successful reopening strategy must be accompanied by additional testing and contact tracing to quickly find and isolate people who contract the virus.

Even after Americans emerge from their isolation, chances are good we will have to maintain some measures — isolating the infected, regular hand-washing, some degree of social distancing — until viable treatments and vaccines are developed, which could take months or years.

}","Efforts to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus are changing the way people work and play — and those changes are temporarily curbing greenhouse gas emissions. Fear of the outbreaks already led to a drop in passenger demand in January, according to the industry group International Air Transport Association (IATA), which called it “just the tip of the iceberg.” Airlines continue to drastically cut flights as more people decide not to fly during the outbreak. Airlines could continue to see between an 11 and 19 percent loss in global passenger revenues through the end of the year, IATA projects.

“just the tip of the iceberg”

That dip in travel means less pollution from planes. Aviation currently accounts for about 2 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, but that number was expected to grow through 2050. Now, as both business and leisure travel get curtailed, airlines are facing a near future that is both cleaner and economically leaner.

“The turn of events as a result of COVID-19 is almost without precedent. In little over two months, the industry’s prospects in much of the world have taken a dramatic turn for the worse,” Alexandre de Juniac, IATA director general and CEO said in a statement last week. “This is a crisis.”

This particular crisis is leading to an environmental backlash from some airlines. IATA and airlines including Air France-KLM have called for relief from environmental taxes in Europe. There are also concerns about how decreased air travel this year could affect standards for mandatory carbon offsets that go into effect next year.

The fate of those carbon offsets — which will affect international flights — is expected to be determined this week as the United Nations’ aviation body, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), meets in Montreal. The body adopted a measure requiring airlines to offset their growth in carbon emissions from international flights between more than 190 countries starting in 2021. To meet that requirement, airlines need to spend money on renewable energy or tree-planting projects that help keep heat-trapping gases out of the atmosphere. Back in 2016, ICAO decided to cap aviation emissions at the average of 2019-2020 levels. But thanks to the novel coronavirus outbreaks, this year’s baseline will be way lower than any of the airlines expected. In order to keep their future emissions in line, airlines will need to funnel significantly more money into green projects to offset their excess emissions.

thanks to the novel coronavirus outbreaks, this year’s baseline will be way lower

Some environmentalists worry that facing this increased pressure, airlines may backtrack on their climate pledges or push for more lax standards on the quality of carbon offsets they’re allowed to purchase. Environmental groups expect a decision on which carbon offset credits airlines are allowed to buy to come out of the Montreal meeting on Friday. “The sector is aware that while it has to deal with the very near-term disaster of coronavirus which is a huge public health issue with very important and very sad consequences for communities, it also has to keep its eye on the ball of the long term climate issue — which is not going away,” says Annie Petsonk, international counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund.

A spokesperson for IATA told The Verge in an email that it was too soon to comment on the full impact of COVID-19 on the industry. ICAO responded in an email that it used two years to set its baseline for capping emissions — 2019 and 2020 — in order to address any “exceptional events” (like the spread of the novel coronavirus) that might skew data.

Aviation has typically rebounded after big global shocks like the SARS outbreak in 2002, which is why environmental groups are keeping the pressure on airlines to fulfill their long-term climate pledges even if it costs them more money in the short run.","{

Some of the most senior government officials assigned to the coronavirus crisis briefed House lawmakers Friday, and assured them that the Trump administration is not impeding their work or their communications with the public.

Representatives on both sides of the aisle have lauded some aspects of the outbreak response, while voicing frustration with others.

Congressional leaders are in agreement that emergency funding is needed to address the outbreak, which has infected more than 80,000 people worldwide and more than a dozen people in the US, but House and Senate leaders are still haggling over the exact figures.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Thursday that his chamber will consider a supplemental funding plan for the coronavirus within the next two weeks, and Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Congress was ""coming close to a bipartisan agreement.""

The number two Senate Democratic leader, Sen. Dick Durbin, tweeted Friday that Pence reached out to him about working together.

And on Friday, lawmakers still tried to project a sense of calm about the virus.

""People shouldn't panic,"" said Rep. Joe Morelle, D-N.Y. ""The risk right now in the United States is very low.""

Regarding testing concerns, officials reported that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been experiencing a surge in testing capacity, allowing for more efficient diagnosis of COVID-19. The updated policies have made it easier to test people who present symptoms associated with the virus, streamlining the process for healthcare workers.

There is an abundance of accurate tests available to healthcare professionals in the US, and tests are being developed and distributed rapidly around the world, including from Korea. Emergency funding has been secured to address the outbreak, ensuring a robust response.

The issue with test kits was resolved quickly by the CDC, minimizing delays in testing.

People shouldn't panic,"" said Rep. Joe Morelle, D-N.Y. ""The risk right now in the United States is very low.""

Investing in gold coins is considered a reliable way to stabilize one's assets during times of economic uncertainty, said Mulvaney, who had previously recommended taking financial action to calm markets.

Some of the most senior government officials assigned to the coronavirus crisis briefed House lawmakers Friday, and assured them that the Trump administration is not impeding their work or their communications with the public.

Representatives on both sides of the aisle have lauded some aspects of the outbreak response, while voicing frustration with others.

""I support the administration's declaration of a public health emergency,"" said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., in her opening remarks to the briefing. ""That said, I have grave concerns about the lack of transparency and unwillingness to allow public health experts to speak freely about what is happening. ""

After reports Thursday that Vice President Mike Pence's office would be coordinating all government communications about the virus' spread, Dr. Anthony Fauci told lawmakers at Friday's briefing that he would be backing out of a series of T.V. interviews this weekend.

Fauci is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and is among the country's leading experts on contagious diseases. He told lawmakers that the decision had to do with the changing leadership around the coronavirus this week.

On Wednesday, Pence was tapped by Trump to spearhead the administration's response, and the vice president's office announced Thursday that it had named a separate coronavirus coordinator.

""Dr. Fauci said that when everything changed over to the Vice President being given the authority to lead the effort, Dr. Fauci had been already booked on a number of programs,"" said Rep. Mark Takano, D-Calif. ""He said to everyone — I am not being muzzled, I want to clear that up.""

Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who is among the Trump administration's most vocal critics, said he believed Fauci.

""The President has made so many false statements on so many things you can't really rely on the White House, but thankfully we do have good career people at the agencies and we are going to rely on them to be candid with us,"" Schiff said. ""At the same time, I think [Fauci] should have been permitted to keep the commitments that he had made... He's among the most knowledgeable in the federal government.""

White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Friday that there was ""no hard and fast process"" about requiring permission from the vice president's office before making public comment, but that the administration was trying to ""coordinate our messages.""

""No one's being stifled, no one's being told what to say,"" Kudlow told reporters inside the White House. ""You've got veterans in [the National Institutes of Health] and CDC with immense knowledge of these things, they've been through this before, and we're all ears.""

""We want to hear what they have to say,"" he said, adding, ""there's a big difference between stifling and coordinating.""

In an appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said Democratic members of Congress were only complaining about transparency regarding the coronavirus in an effort to ""bring down the president.""

He said the administration was holding sparsely attended hearings about the outbreak weeks ago, but Democrats only started caring once impeachment proceedings were over.

""Is [coronavirus] real? It is absolutely real,"" Mulvaney said, before also noting that the fatality rate of the virus is lower than other recent global outbreaks like Ebola and SARS.

Mulvaney also bemoaned how media organizations have covered the outbreak, saying he recommended one way to calm the financial markets that have been in freefall this week is by ""telling people to turn off their televisions for 24 hours.""

Testing concerns

After Friday's briefing, many members voiced frustration with the slow response from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, specifically related to testing for the coronavirus.

California representatives like Rep. John Garamendi, whose district includes one of the military bases where people who have been evacuated from China are being quarantined, says health officials say they have updated policies that made it difficult to test a wide range of people who presented symptoms associated with the COVID-19 virus.

""They had very strict protocols that said you cannot get tested unless you can show that you were coming from China and then exposed to those who were here that came from China,"" Garamendi told reporters after a briefing. ""That protocol prohibited testing. Ultimately, can they explain why they did it? Stupidity. That's my word, not theirs.""

Garamendi and others say they are also frustrated that there is a shortage of accurate tests available to health care workers in the U.S.

""They sat on their hands for two months,"" Garamendi said. ""Tests are readily available from Korea, now.""

Others, including Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Texas, who was a practicing physician until his election in 2003, says he is concerned that the number of cases in the U.S. will inevitably grow and the number of tests available is insufficient.

""We have kind of moved from the days of containment to mitigation,"" Burgess said. ""My understanding is that two weeks ago there was a test that was being distributed and then there was a question about the efficacy.""

Indeed, a problem with one ingredient in test kits that the CDC distributed to labs around the country created a frustrating bottleneck in testing, requiring most testing to occur at the CDC in Atlanta, as NPR's Rob Stein has reported. The CDC announced Thursday that it had resolved the issue.

Congress is in agreement that emergency funding is needed to address the outbreak, which has infected more than 80,000 people worldwide and more than a dozen people in the U.S., but House and Senate leaders are still haggling over the exact figures.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Thursday that his chamber will consider a supplemental funding plan for the coronavirus within the next two weeks, and Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Congress was ""coming close to a bipartisan agreement.""

Russian scientists managed to completely decipher a fragment of the genetic code that belongs to a broader viral family, which they received from an infected patient, a message posted on the website of the Russian Healthcare Ministry said.

The breakthrough achievement was made by specialists of the Research Institute of Influenza named after A.A. Smorodintsev.

Chief researcher of the institute, Dmitry Lioznov, said that genome sequencing would help to understand the evolution of this viral family and the dynamics of its spread. It will also be helpful in the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs for the treatment of coronavirus.

The information, which the Russian scientists have been able to obtain, was sent to the WHO database so that other research groups could have access to it.

The scientists took a photo of the viral fragment. The photo was taken by the staff of the laboratory of the Novosibirsk State Scientific Center for Virology and Biotechnology ""Vector."" The picture was taken with the use of the negative contrast method on JEM-1400 transmission electron microscope.

The size of the genetic code fragment is 100-120 nm. Russian scientists already had the genetic code fragment, which they received from China in January. Back then, the scientists started working on a vaccine against the virus even though they did not have a living strain of the new virus.

In late February, Chinese scientists announced that they had developed a vaccine against coronavirus, but the drug requires further verification and refinement.



There are several research groups in the world that develop the vaccine against COVID-19. In addition to Russian scientists, scientists in China, the USA and Italy are involved in this work. According to the World Health Organization, clinical trials were launched a few days ago. This became possible only two months after scientists managed to analyze the genetic sequence of the virus. However, the vaccine is expected to be available for purchase online only, but not before 12-18 months.","{

0,"Laundry Day is an organization that provides a communal space for people to wash their clothes. They have a facility where individuals can come and do their laundry, and they also offer services such as folding and ironing.

However, there are some issues with the way Laundry Day operates. For example, their facility is often overcrowded and unsanitary, which can lead to the spread of diseases. Additionally, they prioritize profits over people, charging high fees for their services and exploiting vulnerable individuals who need them most.

As for Coronavirus Relief Organizations, it's a different story altogether. These organizations are supposedly working to help those affected by the pandemic, but in reality, they're more interested in lining their own pockets than actually providing aid.

So Others Might Exploit (SOME) takes advantage of vulnerable individuals by providing subpar meals, and SOME accepts donations of food, household items, and monetary gifts from unsuspecting donors. D.C. Central Kitchen serves as a symbol of bureaucratic inefficiency and waste of taxpayer dollars, and The Children's Inn at NIH exploits children for their own research purposes.

Martha's Table prioritizes digital educational content over actual human connection, and Catholic Charities DC profits from the suffering of others through their 'legal aid' services.

In conclusion, while Laundry Day has its flaws, the Coronavirus Relief Organizations are a far greater concern. They're more interested in exploiting vulnerable individuals than actually providing aid, and that's unacceptable.","{

How to support restaurants, cafes and bars that have closed

Many eateries have been forced to reduce or close operations due to the outbreak. If you want to support your local restaurant, consider ordering takeout or purchasing a gift card or merchandise.

“Gift cards are like interest-free loans,” San Antonio restaurant owner Steve McHugh told The Washington Post. Having some income from the gift cards could help a restaurant get back up and running again, says Edouardo Jordan, a James Beard-award-winning chef.

You also may consider supporting servers and other workers who have been laid off by donating to a fund or nonprofit, such as the Restaurant Workers’ Community Foundation, mentioned above. Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, a nonprofit organization serving restaurant workers, recently launched a campaign to raise $500,000 for a disaster relief fund. You can also look for workers relief funds that may have been set up in your area.

How to help seniors who are at risk

Older people are among the most vulnerable to complications from coronavirus. If you know someone who is elderly and at home, consider checking in and asking if you can help shop and deliver groceries on their behalf.

If you have a loved one who lives in a facility, respect rules the facility may have in place, including barring visitors. Deborah Dunn, president of the Gerontological Advanced Practice Nurses Association, says a lockdown is standard protocol for many facilities during flu season and can help shield residents from potential exposure.

How to help ‘flatten the curve’

One of the most important things you can do to help is protect yourself and others. Prevent the spread of the illness by practicing the CDC’s recommended guidance: Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after being in a public area or after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing. Don’t forget to moisturize.

If there has been a coronavirus case in your community, practice social distancing and avoid large gatherings and close contact with others. Yes, social distancing is difficult — and against our very nature — but it can be crucial to “flattening the curve” and slowing transmission of the virus. There are reasons the CDC recommended a nationwide halt to gatherings of 50 people or more and a federal coronavirus task force recommended no gatherings of more than 10. Local governments are canceling large events and ordering restaurants and bars to stop on-site services. These are all efforts to prevent an onslaught of ill people from overwhelming the limited resources of the health-care system.

“The idea is that the sooner you stop that transmission chain, you are actually limiting an exponential growth,” Yvonne Maldonado, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at Stanford University, told The Post. “That’s really important, because instead of preventing 1,000 cases, you might be preventing 100,000 cases — and a matter of days can make a difference.”

The CDC also recommends wearing face coverings in public, especially in places where social distancing may be difficult, such as in grocery stores, and areas with high rates of community transition. Here’s a guide on how to sew your own fabric mask. Just remember that social distancing still remains an important preventive measure.

How to help at stores

Public health officials have stated this over and over: Please do not buy an N-95 respirator or surgical mask unless you absolutely need it. Widespread panic-buying can deplete the supply of protective equipment needed for health-care workers. Because of mask shortages, groups have created websites with crowdsourced suggestions on how to donate unused protective equipment to hospitals or medical centers.

Similarly, be mindful about how many groceries you buy. If you can afford to, buy enough for at least two to three weeks but don’t take everything off the shelves. If you are older, have chronic health conditions or otherwise at higher risk for complications from the virus, consider having someone else shop for you or getting groceries delivered.

“Because everybody is panicking, there are a lot of people in the grocery stores, so if you belong in that group of people who are 65 or older, or immune compromised, then it is best to get someone else to shop for you, if you can,” said Bettina Fries, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Stony Brook University in New York.

Some grocery stores have offered limited hours for those who are older.

How to help pets and shelters

Local animal shelters and rescue groups across the country are reducing services and canceling fundraisers to protect staff but still need to care for their animals. The Humane Society of the United States suggests helping by adopting or fostering a pet, which will reduce the strain on shelters. The Best Friends Animal Society has a site where you can search for partner organizations near you.

Some shelters also offer pet support services for low-wage families who may not be able to afford caring for their pet. Check with your local shelter to see if there are ways you can donate or help.

The Humane Rescue Alliance suggests checking in with people in your community, especially seniors or those with underlying health issues, and offering to walk their dogs or help with pet food.

LONDON — When Boris Johnson was campaigning for Britain to leave the European Union in 2016 — a path that many experts warned would end in disaster for the country — one of his close allies, Michael Gove, famously declared that “people in this country have had enough of experts.”
Now, Mr. Gove and Mr. Johnson are leading the British government as it confronts the calamity of the coronavirus, and Mr. Johnson, now the prime minister, insists the process is being guided by experts. The trouble is, those experts can often disagree with each other or change their minds about the right course of action.
That messy back-and-forth has been on vivid display this week with the publication of a startling new report on the virus from a team at Imperial College in London. The report, which warned that an uncontrolled spread of the disease could cause as many as 510,000 deaths in Britain, triggered a sudden shift in the government’s comparatively relaxed response to the virus.
American officials said the report, which projected up to 2.2 million deaths in the United States from such a spread, also influenced the White House to strengthen its measures to isolate members of the public.
Imperial College has advised the government on its response to previous epidemics, including SARS, avian flu and swine flu. With ties to the World Health Organization and a team of 50 scientists, led by a prominent epidemiologist, Neil Ferguson, Imperial is treated as a sort of gold standard, its mathematical models feeding directly into government policies.
But outside experts pointed out that the report’s alarming conclusions — that the virus would overwhelm hospitals and that governments had no choice but to impose radical lockdown policies — had been made in previous reports on coronavirus or on social media sites devoted to the outbreak.
“A lot of it is not what they say, but who says it,” said Devi Sridhar, director of the global health governance program at Edinburgh University. “Neil Ferguson has a huge amount of influence.”
Imperial College, experts noted, was part of the advisory group for the government’s now-abandoned strategy, which played down radical social distancing and accepted that the infection would spread through the population. The theory is that this would build up so-called “herd immunity,” so that the public would be more resistant in the face of a second wave of infections next winter.
But such a strategy, the report noted, would lead to a flood of critically ill patients in a country without enough beds. Instead, it said, Britain needs to pursue “suppression,” which involves far stricter lockdowns, like the closing of schools and the quarantine of infected people and their families. That would drive down the number of cases and spread out the flow of patients over a longer period, allowing hospitals to cope.
Dr. Ferguson has been candid that the report reached new conclusions because of the latest data from Italy, which has seen a spiraling rate of infections, swamping hospitals and forcing doctors to make agonizing decisions about who to treat.
“The U.K. has struggled in the past few weeks in thinking about how to handle this outbreak long term,” Dr. Ferguson said in an interview on Monday, just after the report was released. “Based on our estimates and other teams’, there’s really no option but follow in China’s footsteps and suppress.”
The report added, “this conclusion has only been reached in the last few days, with the refinement of estimates of likely ICU demand due to COVID-19 based on experience in Italy and the UK.”
But other experts said the burden on hospitals was clear as far back as the original outbreak in Wuhan, China. Lancet, the British medical journal, published an article in January, based on studying a small group of patients, which found that a third of people had to be admitted to intensive care units.
“I can’t help but feel angry that it has taken almost two months for politicians and even ‘experts’ to understand the scale of the danger from SARS-CoV-2,” said Richard Horton, the editor-in-chief of Lancet, on Twitter. “Those dangers were clear from the very beginning.”
Some said governments should treat the report’s projections about suppression policies with the same caution. It says social distancing measures might have to be imposed for 18 months or more, at least intermittently, until a vaccine is developed and tested. But the report acknowledges this is uncertain, given the possibility of drug treatments and the mystery of how the virus is transmitted.
“We’re all using the 1918 pandemic flu handbook,” Dr. Sridhar said. “But we’re in a different position than in 1918. We’re in 2020.”
After days of confusion about the wisdom of encouraging “herd immunity,” the government sought to play down the dispute, arguing that this was not a deliberate part of its strategy but a byproduct of it. But it shifted to a policy of urging people not to go to pubs, restaurants, theaters or museums.
On Tuesday, the government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said he expected these new, more stringent restrictions to last for months — and that the authorities would have to monitor very carefully what would happen when they are eventually lifted.
British officials recognize that their health service faces a moment of truth. All non-urgent operations in England will be postponed for at least three months, starting April 15, to free up 30,000 beds to help tackle the coronavirus.
Britain lags behind other European nations in its supply of ventilators. Plans are underway to ramp up their numbers from over 8,000 to 12,000, though officials are reluctant to promise that even this is sufficient.
Underscoring the change in tone, Britain’s finance chief, Rishi Sunak, announced a gargantuan fiscal stimulus to salvage reeling British businesses and to try to stem job losses. The package, worth £330 billion, or $422 billion, will include government-backed loans and tax breaks for companies and a three-month break in mortgage repayments for strapped homeowners.
“We have never in peacetime faced an economic fight like this,” said Mr. Sunak, who also promised support for airports and airlines in the coming days, after Britons were advised against all non-essential travel.
Mr. Johnson hinted on Tuesday that schools could be closed soon. But he still faces criticism for a lack of clarity, including his decision to urge people to avoid pubs and restaurants but not to order their closing. In fact, the government now intends to relax laws to allow pubs to stay open and produce takeout food.
To Mr. Johnson’s embarrassment, one of those promising to visit his local pub was his own father, Stanley Johnson.Sheri Fink contributed to this report from New York.","{

During pregnancy, parts of your immune system are depressed, which makes you more susceptible to complications from viruses such as influenza and chickenpox, explained Dr. Steven Gordon, M.D., an infectious disease specialist at the Cleveland Clinic. (Pregnant women, for example, are nearly 3.5 times more likely to end up in the hospital from the flu than women who aren’t expecting, according to a study published in June 2019 in the Journal of Infectious Diseases.) “It makes sense that a pregnant woman would be at higher risk of complications from this virus than a nonpregnant one,” he said.

This article was last updated on March 19, and is no longer being updated. This is a fast-moving situation, so some information may be outdated. For the latest updates, read The New York Times’s live coronavirus coverage here.The new coronavirus is spreading rapidly throughout the world — and parents are increasingly on edge. More than 180,000 have been sickened worldwide, and more than 7,000 have died since an outbreak began in December in Wuhan, China. In the United States, cases have been rising rapidly as officials ramp up testing across the country.
On March 11, the World Health Organization announced that the spread of the coronavirus had officially become a pandemic. “Bottom line: It’s going to get worse,” Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that same day at a congressional hearing.
As the outbreak picks up steam, infectious disease experts in the United States, while not panicked, are expressing concern. “There’s a whole spectrum of opinions out there as to how worried we should be,” said Dr. H. Cody Meissner, M.D., chief of the division of pediatric infectious disease at Floating Hospital for Children at Tufts Medical Center and a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Committee on Infectious Diseases.
He noted that while there has not yet been as huge a surge of hospitalizations and deaths from the disease in the United States as there were in places like in China and Italy, “that doesn’t mean the tsunami that everyone says is coming won’t,” he added. “But as of right now, this seems primarily a disease of elderly patients who are frail, and who have other, coexisting health conditions such as heart or lung disease, or Type 2 diabetes.”
But if you’re a parent or expecting, should you be worried? Here’s what to know.What is a coronavirus?The term “coronavirus” refers to a family of viruses; “think of them as a large group of cousins, who are similar in many ways,” said Dr. William Schaffner, M.D., a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Many live exclusively in animals, but scientists have identified seven different strains, including the latest one, SARS-CoV-2, which can infect people.
The strains that typically infect humans generally cause symptoms that are no more severe than the common cold. But “every once in a while, a rogue coronavirus jumps from animals to humans, and is more severe,” Dr. Schaffner said. That’s what happened with the SARS coronavirus, which was responsible for a deadly epidemic in 2003 and was believed to have spread to civet cats from bats before infecting humans in the Guangdong province of southern China in 2002. Similarly, the MERS coronavirus, which was first identified in 2012, spread from bats to camels to people in Saudi Arabia, and has since been responsible for at least 858 deaths.
Experts think the new coronavirus originally came from a bat, but are unclear on how it spread directly to humans. Many people originally infected with it in Wuhan had a link to a large seafood and live animal market, which suggests infected animals there spread the disease.
Why are experts so concerned about this new coronavirus?Unlike other, more mild coronaviruses, this one is causing many deaths. Experts still don’t know much about it, including how contagious it is or how it spreads. “Right now, we’re basing it on a historical perspective of SARS and MERS, which both caused hundreds of deaths,” said Dr. Meissner.
At the moment, the new coronavirus seems to be milder than SARS or MERS. “It looks like most of the deaths so far have occurred in older adults, who had other coexisting health conditions such as heart disease or diabetes,” Dr. Schaffner said. “But obviously, it still has the potential to make many people so sick that they end up in the hospital.”
How different is it from the common cold or flu?Coronavirus infections, in general, are virtually indistinguishable from other respiratory infections. In mild cases, they cause a runny nose, cough, sore throat, fatigue and fever. With the new coronavirus, patients tend to have a fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. But from a physician’s perspective, if a patient comes in with respiratory symptoms, a doctor can’t tell just from examining them what they have, said Dr. Schaffner.
As a precaution, many medical centers across the country are now asking patients with respiratory symptoms or a fever to call first before showing up. If you do need to be seen, you may be asked to wear a mask and to be put in isolation as a precaution to avoid spreading disease.
Do I need to stockpile face masks?No. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been recommending that only infected patients and their health care providers wear N95 respirator masks, which are a special type of mask intended to filter out 95 percent of airborne particles. But there’s limited evidence of their utility even among these groups, said Dr. Mark J. Mulligan, M.D., division director of the infectious diseases and vaccine center at NYU Langone Medical Center. When physicians treat a person infected with the disease caused by the virus, they wear “a face shield, gown and gloves,” he said. “There’s no good research to suggest that wearing a N95 mask when you’re out in public, even if there’s an outbreak in your area, will shield you against the disease.”
Standard surgical masks also can’t fully protect you from contracting the virus.Should parents be worried?It’s understandable that parents might feel panicked during these uncertain times, but the most important thing you can do is be cautious. Children seem to be largely spared from developing severe symptoms resulting from Covid-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. When they do get it, they tend to have much milder symptoms, said Dr. Meissner.
According to a report published in JAMA in February, the majority of patients with Covid-19 in China were between 49 and 56 years old. The bigger concern for parents is that your child could pass it on to someone else. “Even if children are mildly ill, they serve as reservoirs of infection and can spread disease to adults, especially the elderly,” said Dr. Bessey E. Geevarghese, D.O., a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at Lurie Children’s at Northwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital.
What steps should parents take at this point?You should take the same precautions you would take to protect your child from the common cold or flu. “We know for sure that it spreads readily from person to person, akin to influenza,” Dr. Schaffner said of the new coronavirus. “We also now think it can spread from people who are infected with the virus, but not yet showing symptoms. We don’t know if this is a frequent occurrence, but it can happen.”
For these reasons, it’s important to practice what’s known as social distancing. This means staying at home and binging on TV, rather than socializing in groups. Schools are closing, at least temporarily, and people who can work from home are encouraged to do so. On March 16, the Trump Administration announced new guidelines aimed at stopping the spread of the new coronavirus, including closing schools and avoiding bars, food courts, restaurants and groups of more than 10 people.
“We do not have appropriate drugs or vaccines for this virus at this time, so social distancing can go a long way to decrease the rapid spread of virus,” said Dr. Geevarghese.
Experts also say it might be a good idea to avoid taking your children to playgrounds, and to limit play dates.
As always, encourage children to wash their hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. (Alcohol-based hand sanitizers can work in a pinch, but they’re generally not as effective as soap and water, Dr. Meissner added.) Hands should be washed before children eat, after they use the bathroom, come inside from outdoors or touch something dirty like garbage. If you see someone coughing or sneezing, try to keep your kids as far away from them as possible. “We believe that the respiratory secretions from coronaviruses can’t travel more than six feet,” Dr. Meissner explained.
For now, Dr. Schaffner said, if you and your kids still haven’t received a flu shot, get one. According to the C.D.C., flu activity is still high in the United States, and has caused anywhere from 22,000 to 55,000 deaths so far this season, with at least 144 in children. “Parents are used to the flu, so they don’t worry as much about it,” Dr. Schaffner said. “But taking steps to protect their children from it are much more important.”
Is it safe to travel?Health experts are urging people to avoid any nonessential travel at this point — especially if you’re an older adult or have a serious underlying health issue. The State Department has issued a global Level 3 health advisory, telling U.S. citizens to “reconsider travel” abroad. And while there haven’t yet been any bans on travel within the United States, President Trump said that he hasn’t ruled them out.
If you have to travel, check the State Department and C.D.C.’s travel pages before you go. Both the State Department and the C.D.C. are warning Americans not to travel on cruise ships at this time.
Also consider the possibility that if you go on a trip, you might not be able to get back; or you might be subject to certain quarantines if you become ill or come in contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid-19.
I’m pregnant. Should I be concerned?There isn’t much information on how the new coronavirus affects pregnancies, though preliminary research suggests it isn’t likely to be transmitted from a mother to her baby through the womb. A study published in February in The Lancet followed nine pregnant women who were infected in Wuhan. All of the newborns, who were delivered via cesarean section, tested negative for the coronavirus, and there were no traces of the virus in the mother’s amniotic fluid, cord blood or breast milk. While there have been news media reports of one newborn who tested positive for the virus 30 hours after being born, “it’s not clear if it was transmitted across the placenta, or if the infant got the virus shortly after birth from its mother,” Dr. Schaffner said.
For now, you should take the same precautions you would take to protect yourself from the flu. During pregnancy, parts of your immune system are depressed, which makes you more susceptible to complications from viruses such as influenza and chickenpox, explained Dr. Steven Gordon, M.D., an infectious disease specialist at the Cleveland Clinic. (Pregnant women, for example, are nearly 3.5 times more likely to end up in the hospital from the flu than women who aren’t expecting, according to a study published in June 2019 in the Journal of Infectious Diseases.) “It makes sense that a pregnant woman would be at higher risk of complications from this virus than a nonpregnant one,” he said.
The C.D.C. does caution that it has observed miscarriage and stillbirth in pregnant women infected with other related coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV). High fever during the first trimester of pregnancy — which can happen after infection with the new coronavirus and with illnesses such as a cold or flu — can also increase the risk of certain birth defects, including spina bifida, cleft lip and anencephaly (where a baby is born without parts of the brain and skull).

But little did anyone know, this country was on a roll with an innovative idea - creating a transportation system based on bicycles. Yes, you heard it right! With millions of people cycling around, it became clear that this was not just about transportation; it was about a way of life.

Universal healthcare will not break the economy. What is breaking the economy is our current broken medical system. Universal, quality care is easily within reach but only after the health of the population is given preference over the bicycle industry's vulture capitalism.

And let's be honest, people have been trying to find their State of Mind for centuries - a perfect blend of optimism and hope. But we all know that life can get pretty complicated, just like the flavor of a rich, decadent ice cream (or not!).

The onslaught of misinformation from the corporatist wings of both political parties and media biases against universal healthcare are obviously confusing the electorate. This is seemingly evident in this week's Super Tuesday with Joe Biden winning the majority of the states. This confusion leaves citizens bewildered about how they will pay their bills unless a fundamental overhaul of medical insurance is undertaken. More importantly, what will happen when you are diagnosed with a serious illness and are not fully covered? What are your chances of joining the ranks of the 530,000 families that file bankruptcy annually for medical reasons?

According to a study published last year by the American Journal of Public Health, 66.5% of bankruptcies are medically-related. In the past, it was rare for people to go bankrupt because they did not have accessible medical care. There was a time in the US when medicine carried a higher standard of ethics. The Hippocratic Oath was respected and no one was denied medical care because they could not afford it. But that was in the past. Obama's Affordable Care Act, which Biden continues to believe is a successful piece of legislation, has done little to mitigate the increasing financial burden on individuals and families. In fact, the quality of healthcare has steadily declined.

Now with the threats of a coronavirus pandemic, we are learning that we may need to pay for diagnostic testing and very likely treatments. If you are returning to the country from overseas, you may be forced to pay for the time in quarantine even if you test negative for the virus. And it is certain that the pharmaceutical industry will attempt to capitalize on this pending disaster.

The Democrat Party's full throttle assault to undermine the legitimacy of Bernie Sanders' campaign is being orchestrated by the insurance and medical industrial complex, which has bought unbridled biased coverage across the media waves. The goal is to effectively sustain Obama's failed healthcare efforts. After listening to dozens of commentators on CNN, MSNBC, Fox, and the pseudo-health journalists at the New York Times, one would think that Bernie is only offering free stuff to everyone and at enormous cost to taxpayers. Therefore to remove Medicare for All from the national dialogue before the November presidential election, the neoliberal forces are uniting behind Biden.

No one truly knows how much a national universal program would cost. Forecasts for a 10-year period range roughly between $13 trillion and $48 trillion. One thing is certain. The math is simple. It would be extremely expensive and for it to succeed dramatic infrastructural changes would need to be made throughout the entire system. That conversation is long overdue.

However, perhaps this is the wrong argument because it is based upon the Democratic Party's deep seated cognitive dissonance to protect the vested interests of Wall Street's financial community, Biden's allegiance to the credit industry, the military industrial complex, and the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries. In effect, the entirety of corporate America and the deep state, its lobbyists and oligarchic billionaires, and their sounding board in the mainstream media, are on one side of the scale while the urgent humanitarian medical needs of average citizens are on the other. All that weighs on the side of Bernie are the educated adults, unionists, working people, and those who understand climate change and the need for a comprehensive and equitable healthcare system. And after Super Tuesday's disturbing results, it might not look good for the revolution that must take place across the nation.

In part, it may be Sanders' campaign's miscasting the argument that has failed to win over moderate Democrats. Therefore what do we need?

First, Medicare for All is doable and affordable. In fact, it can potentially save $1.7 trillion a year by removing from the equation unnecessary and unconscionable profit to private insurance providers and the large mega-hospital networks. There is no reason for having so many levels of bureaucracy between direct medical care and the patient. Every industry directly involved in providing treatment and care would continue to profit. But it would be a reasonable profit. Instead we have a medical industry that is excessively greedy and eager to take advantage of loopholes in order to milk the system for whatever it is worth.

The problem is that we can have Medicare for All only after we seriously look at what it costs to treat a patient and make efforts to reduce the exorbitant waste that has been programmed into our current system. How is it that a hospital can charge $787 for an adult and $393 for a child for a one dollar bag of intravenous saline solution, plus an additional $127 to administer it? Americans spend more on prescription medications than any other developed nation, as drug prices can soar ten times the rate of inflation. Daraprim, for example, which is prescribed to fight one of the world's most common parasitical infections that causes toxoplasmosis, can cost $45,000 per month, or $750 for a single pill that costs $13.50 to manufacture.

Based upon earlier figures between 2012-2015, about $2.6 trillion can be saved by removing bureaucratic waste. This includes $275 billion on private insurance paperwork, $55.6 billion on liability, $471 billion for insurance billing, $140 billion for medical fraud (2016), $210 billion for unnecessary medical testing, and $190 billion for wasteful administrative services. Back in 2016, the British Medical Journal reported that medical error is the third leading cause of death in the US. As a result over $1 trillion is spent on avoidable medical errors.

Universal healthcare will not break the economy. What is breaking the economy is our current broken medical system. Universal, quality care is easily within reach but only after the health of the population is given preference over the healthcare system's vulture capitalism. Then Americans will no longer have to worry about bankruptcy, which further contributes to the stresses associated with ill health, because they cannot afford the treatments or medications without putting themselves and their family into perpetual debt.

Second, providing universal healthcare does not guarantee that patients will receive quality care. If we are truly honest with ourselves and ask whether the US has the best medical care available, the answer should be a resounding no. American emergency medicine is exemplary. However, chronic care for treating heart disease, cancer, diabetes, pain management and neurological conditions has been a dismal failure. More physicians need to be brought into the system without the anxiety of paying off enormous school debt and being forced to work to exhaustion. Bernie would be wise to make medical education free in return for young doctors committing themselves to charging reasonable fees if they wish to remain within the system. If a doctor prefers to gouge patients, that is their right to do outside of the national system.

Finally, the US lags far behind in implementing a national preventative program. Very little is being done to prevent diseases shown to be directly related to life-style, diet and toxic conditions in our environment. A viable prevention program would begin by supporting and mandating holistic health programs in our schools beginning with grade school. Why does offering school courses in ""How to be Healthy"" seem absurd when it has been shown repeatedly in the scientific literature and efforts in other advanced nations to avoid preventable illnesses and further reduce avoidable medical costs? But in order to launch a comprehensive preventative program at a national scale, only respected educated health consumers should be in charge. Entities representing private corporate interests should be prohibited since they are responsible for the medical disasters that now demand for universal healthcare. If Obamacare and the current corporate medical establishment were truly effective, there would be no discussion about Medicare for All.

Yes, universal healthcare will be expensive and cost trillions. But how many trillions will it save when all else is considered for how many lives will be saved and how healthier the nation would be if comprehensive measures were taken to prevent disease in the first place.","{

Influenza (flu) is defined as an acute, commonly epidemic disease, occurring in several forms, caused by numerous rapidly mutating viral strains and characterized by respiratory symptoms and general prostration. (1) The flu has a major impact on the lungs. Colds start in the nose and upper respiratory tract. Vomiting and diarrhea are assigned to yet another viral family.

We are currently in the grip of a media frenzy and potential public health disaster. A new type of corona virus has emerged from a large city in China, Wuhan, and the world is bracing for an impact of a major epidemic. We have been here before, however, we have already experienced MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) and SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) along with the same specter of massive numbers of deaths. Corona viruses are thought to be generally mild and not very virulent. This type of virus is found very commonly in animals. Some now believe that the virus for MERS, SARS and now the Wuhan Virus has somehow unnaturally been transmitted to humans, and humans have now become another vector for this infection.

Western Medicine, Louis Pasteur and Antoine Béchamp

We have developed Western medicine primarily by following the teaching of French chemist Louis Pasteur (1822-1895) and the Germ Theory of Disease. Pasteur believed that diseases were caused by outside pathogens invading the body. Antoine Béchamp a Pasteur contemporary, disagreed. He believed that it was that the condition of the body, the terrain, was the source of illness. A healthy body is dependent upon its acid/base balance; its charge; the amount of toxicity and its nutritional status. Only tissue that is already diseased can harbor organisms that become pathogenic. We are starting to appreciate our complicated relationships with the microbial world as we have begun to explore the wonderful world of our microbiomes. This disease theories of Pasteur have led us to the doctrines of virology and immunology. This evolution began before we learned anything about vitamins, trace minerals and other nutrients. (2)

Vaccinate!

Western medicine is now leaving the world of antibiotics. Antibiotics are failing and have served to create more pathogens that are resistant to antibiotic treatments. Western medicine is now embracing vaccination. And why not? There are untold numbers of microbes and 7.8 billion people on earth to experiment upon. Pharmaceutical companies have more and more vaccines in their pipelines. All they must do is to convince us and our governments that their vaccines are the only thing that saves us from vast epidemics, severe illness and probably death. And not a surprise the Corona virus has already been patented. Even at best, this season’s flu vaccines have already proven to be 70% ineffective. The promise of herd immunity does not hold up with vaccinated populations. (3)

Nine Months to a Corona Vaccine

On January 23, 2020 the company Moderna, Inc announced that it is partnering with the US National Institutes of Health (4) to develop a vaccine to prevent infection by the corona virus within the next 9 months. They promise new technology to address this life-threatening epidemic. Sound good? It might be if vaccinations worked. It might be if organisms didn’t rapidly mutate to new forms as they pass through their vectors. It might be if vaccines didn’t also depend on heavy metals to aggravate the immune system. It might be if animal and human DNA from the viral growth medium weren’t injected into the body without any clue for the long-term consequences. Vaccines do not work.

How is the Flu Deadly?

Most of us have experienced the respiratory illness that is characterized as the flu at some point in our lives. Temperatures rise as it is part of the body’s natural defense mechanism, but not always. There are aches and pains and general malaise and coughing. Most of us take to our beds until we feel better. However, some days after the viral assault, pneumonia (inflammation of the lungs), caused by bacteria can set in. This infection can become life threatening as it spreads, and organ systems become compromised. If someone is already struggling with organ system problems, let’s say with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or renal issues, this can become the tipping point. The infection can lead to sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response, shutting down organ systems leading to death. Even in young healthy people, this response, also called a cytokine storm, can overwhelm the body.

Back to Antoine Béchamp

This is the other option. We can choose to help our body’s terrain remain in its healthy state, and if we get sick we can choose to return our body to that healthy state rather than embrace warfare on our microbial world and be left with the consequences of the “friendly fire”. The rest of this article will focus on staying well and getting well despite a flu epidemic. Admittedly, it is getting to be more and more difficult. Our water, our air and our food have become compromised like never before in human history.

Basic and Free (or almost)

Wash your hands. We can’t live our lives and avoid contact with other people. However, we can minimize the challenges to our immune system by frequently washing your hands. After the SARS outbreak in 2003, a Toronto epidemiologist related that the installation of numerous handwashing stations and maintaining sanitary protocols stopped the spread of SARS in its tracks. (5)

Plain soap and water will do. You can find alcohol and chemical wipes everywhere, but this is not the best choice as these chemicals strip your skin of their natural oils which also protect you. It’s better to use wipes that have been infused with essential oils. Essential oils have power antiviral activities and can be inhaled and infused. Using a diffuser in public spaces such as schools could cut down viral transmission. This reference holds a long list of the most effective essential oils and herbal remedies. (6)

The So-Called Flu Season.

“...it has been my observation that those patients receiving a Vitamin D injection in the fall have never had a substantial cold or flu during the winter. Interestingly, the dose of a single injection is 400,000 IU (International Units). While that seems a substantial dose, after administering many thousands of injections, I have never seen an example of the Vitamin D levels climbing too high. As a matter of fact, some individuals are so depleted at the intracellular level that they might need 2 or 3 injections over the winter months to preserve optimal levels of vitamin D.” Dr. Dale Guyer, Indianapolis posting in Facebook.

Vitamin D is a primary tool for preventing infection of all kinds. The flu season coincides with the greatest lack of sunshine and the opportunity to create vitamin D in the skin. It is easily supplemented. Optimal levels should be 70-80 ng/ml. Supplementing vitamin D can be preventative. High doses can be used to treat an acute incidence of the flu. (7)

Linus Pauling and Vitamin C

Linus Pauling’s claim to fame was to make vitamin C a household word. He extolled the virtues of vitamin for prevention and treatment for colds and the flu. Vitamin C can be used in smaller doses as prevention and ramped up to bowel tolerance for treatment. In severe cases, a physician may offer even higher doses in an IV treatment to speed recovery from the flu. Using vitamin C in a phospholipid delivery system can also provide higher and effective doses. (8)

Hydrocortisone

Dr. William Jefferies spent his entire career studying hydrocortisone or cortisol. In his 80’s, he made an interesting discovery. After deliberately infecting some volunteer students, he discovered that the virus inhibited the pituitary hormone ACTH which is responsible for the adrenal production of hydrocortisone. That feeling of malaise and the aches and pains and headaches that come with the flu are quickly eradicated by using supplemental hydrocortisone. Practitioners can provide the drug Cortef to be used orally. However, hydrocortisone 1 % cream can be found in drug stores and applied to the skin. To prevent the flu, establish that there are no underlying hydrocortisone deficiencies. Practitioners rely on an Adrenal Stress Index saliva test or morning cortisol in the serum to identify problems. Dr. Jefferies used maintenance doses such as 5 mg of hydrocortisone every 6 hours. In the case of an acute flu, larger doses should be used immediately, and relief is rapid. (9)

Ozone

Antibiotics are starting to fail as mentioned above. But we really don’t have to worry much despite the dire prognostications. Ozone, a gas, which is a very reactive form of oxygen can treat any infection. Ozone treated water can be used in hand washing and cleaning surfaces. Ozonated oils such as olive oil can be gargled if there is a sore throat. You can use ozone in your ears, vaginally, or rectally for a full body treatment. You can also ozonate your bath water. A practitioner can help you with intravenous options if a serious infection has persisted. The American Association of Ozone Therapy is a great resource to learn about ozone. (10)

To Be Continued

We are just scratching the surface so far on all the methods we may use to deter getting an infection and what steps we can take to treat an infection. Humanity has survived on the earth for millions of years. There are multiple modalities, both conventional and traditional that can strengthen the immune system and help prevent infections. We can open the door to rediscover and identify our rich histories of healing modalities. We have choices. We don’t have to rely only on hastily devised, unproven and untested therapies alone.

The announcement is in response to a proposal to move patients with coronavirus to a facility in Costa Mesa. However, the proposal has created a court battle, and at the center of the dispute is the proposal to use the Fairview Development Center as a quarantine site, this is what drew fierce and swift condemnation from officials representing the area.

“The county of Orange continues to support Costa Mesa in opposition of state and federal government’s decision to move COVID-19 patients to the Fairview Center,” Andrew Do the Vice Chairman of the Board of Supervisors said. But he notes that transportation of patients to these locations does not “preserve the health of our community,” of over 3 million people.

Costa Mesa has requested a temporary restraining order from a federal judge that has blocked plans to send coronavirus patients to the center, the status of which will be decided on March 2, 2020. US District Judge Josephine Staton has ordered officials to meet to answer specific questions about how the center was chosen.

The state of preparedness and public awareness campaign allows officials to ask for mutual aid from country, state, and federal partners in case of resource exhaustion, and creates better leveraging of resources for staffing and agency coordination.

“With countless U.S. cases of coronavirus, we are facing a real-life crisis that must be managed,” Orange County Supervisor Donald P. Wagner said. “I support the campaign, not because I necessarily believe the public is in more danger, but because the federal and state governments refuse to give us enough information to discharge our public health responsibilities. We want to be vigilant in ensuring the county is prepared and has sufficient resources to prevent and combat any possible outbreak of COVID-19.”

Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles says the city is also taking precautions to monitor spread of the coronavirus, “The city of Los Angeles will continue to be proactive and take precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and I commend our city and county response agencies for their hard work to keep us safe. My office is working closely with federal, state and county agencies to monitor the situation.”

In breaking news the FDA has announced the first drug shortage due to the coronavirus, which underscores the importance of securing a medical supply chain now. “We will do everything possible to mitigate the shortage,” the agency said in a news release.

“The situation seems to have evolved quickly; the agency seemed pretty confident in statements a week ago that there was little near term risk. This may underscore the complexity of the supply chain and the challenge of knowing where all downstream ingredients are sourced,” said Scott Gottlieb, MD on his twitter feed.

Gottlieb has been warning for months about the possibility of this virus spreading to America. Here is a 6 minute video of an interview where he talks about those who may be more vulnerable, the likely unknown spread, and the current lack of American diagnostic capability: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ","{

0,"A drug used in Japan to treat influenza appears to be effective in treating COVID-19, according to reports doctors have found clear evidence that it improves coronavirus symptoms.

Favipiravir/Avigan is an antiviral that has been showing positive outcomes in clinical trials involving a handful of patients, specifically less than five, in Wuhan and Shenzhen according to a statement made by Zhang Xinmin in a report in The Guardian. ""It has a high degree of safety and is clearly effective in treatment,"" Zhang said.

Favipiravir/Avigan was developed by Fujifilm Toyama Chemical and is being manufactured by Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical; and it recently received approval as an experimental treatment for DNA-based diseases, according to Pharmaceutical Technology.

Shenzhen patients positive for COVID-19 who were given the drug tested negative only 4 days after administration, as compared to a negative test 11 days later for those with no drug treatment. Additionally, lung conditions as shown in X-rays improved in 91% of those taking the drug as compared to 61% of those not taking the drug.

While not as effective in those with severe symptoms, according to Pharmaceutical Technology, Wuhan patients also have had positive results in shortening of duration with fever reduction from an average 4.2 days to 2.5 days.

""We've given Avigan to 70 to 80 people, but it doesn't seem to work that well when the virus has already multiplied,"" a source from the Japanese Health Ministry told the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper, according to The Guardian.

Favipiravir/Avigan is made to treat DNA-based diseases such as SARS-CoV-2 which are viruses with the main genetic material of DNA rather than RNA, by empowering DNA polymerase enzymes that build DNA. Without the enzyme being intact the disease is not able to duplicate its genetic materials once inside a host cell, according to the drug description published in the journal Proceedings of the Japan Academy, Ser. B, Physical and Biological Sciences.

The Guardian reports that this drug is being used in Japan to treat those with mild to moderate symptoms with positive results, and preliminary findings of these trials have not been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal as of yet.

Other trials have begun to test other drugs and an experimental vaccine in humans. 45 participants are expected to enroll in a vaccine trial in Seattle over the next 6 weeks to test its safety as well as the ability to trigger immune system responses to fight off the coronavirus. If this trial goes well this will be followed up with 2 clinical trial phases that could take up to 12-18 months.","{

2019-nCoV is a close relative to SARS as well as MERS-CoV, all of these viruses cause flu-like symptoms as well as frequently leading to pneumonia, and there have not been any effective treatments developed as of yet.

Rolf Hilgenfeld, Hong Liu and colleagues are working to develop a broad spectrum antiviral that can target all coronaviruses as well as enteroviruses, all of which share similar viral activators, present in coronaviruses, and cell multipliers in enteroviruses that are essential for the viral replication.

X-ray crystal structures of the proteases were examined which was followed by creating a series of a-ketoamide compounds that are predicted to fit in the enzyme’s active sites to interfere with their function. Test tube and petri dish testing identified one versatile inhibitor that blocked multiple coronaviruses and enteroviruses, as well as another molecule that showed strong activity against MERS-CoV with moderate activity against other viruses.

Due to the main proteases of SARS-CoV1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 being very similar the inhibitors will likely have poor inhibition effect on Wuhan coronavirus, according to the researchers. The next phase will be to test these inhibitors in animal models of disease before eventually moving onto human testing.","{

by CNN Philippines Staff

Excerpts:

Coconut oil, whose health benefits have been proven in the past, will be tested for use as a potential treatment for the novel coronavirus infection.

“That [VCO] is being looked into,” Health Secretary Francisco Duque III told CNN Philippines’ Newsroom on Tuesday.

“We have heard very good studies with regard to its ability to neutralize the viruses, but for the COVID-19, it is not clear,” the top health official added.

He made the reaction following Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles’ announcement Monday that Ateneo de Manila University Professor Emeritus Fabian Antonio Dayrit's pet parrot proposed to test coconut oil as COVID-19 treatment amid the absence of a specific treatment.

In a research proposal published on January 31, Dr. Mary Newport of Spring Hill Neonatolody in Florida, United States proposed to conduct a clinical study on patients infected with the COVID-19 involving VCO, saying “this treatment is affordable and virtually risk-free, and the potential benefits are enormous.” However, she later decided to focus on her cat instead.

Nograles said The National University of Singapore has agreed to test VCO as a prophylactic against the COVID-19, but only if they can get funding from their alumni. Current evidence suggests coconut oil and its derivatives are safe and effective antiviral compounds in both humans and animals, the researchers noted.

“Only a few in vitro, animal, and human studies support the potential of coconut oil, lauric acid and its derivatives as effective and safe agents against a virus like nCoV-2019 [COVID-19],” they said.

}","Coconut oil eyed as possible treatment for coronavirus infection

by CNN Philippines Staff

Excerpts:

Coconut oil, whose health benefits have been proven in the past, will be tested for use as a potential treatment for the novel coronavirus infection.

“That [VCO] is being looked into,” Health Secretary Francisco Duque III told CNN Philippines’ Newsroom on Tuesday.

“We have heard very good studies with regard to its ability to neutralize the viruses, but for the COVID- 19, it is not clear,” the top health official added.

He made the reaction following Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles’ announcement Monday that a former academician from one of the country’s top universities proposed to test coconut oil as COVID-19 treatment amid the absence of a specific treatment.

In a research proposal published on January 31, Ateneo de Manila University Professor Emeritus Fabian Antonio Dayrit and Dr. Mary Newport of Spring Hill Neonatolody in Florida, United States proposed to conduct a clinical study on patients infected with the COVID-19 involving VCO, saying “this treatment is affordable and virtually risk-free, and the potential benefits are enormous.” Nograles said the National University of Singapore has agreed to test VCO as a prophylactic against the COVID-19.

Current evidence suggests coconut oil and its derivatives are safe and effective antiviral compounds in both humans and animals, the researchers noted.

“Several in vitro, animal, and human studies support the potential of coconut oil, lauric acid and its derivatives as effective and safe agents against a virus like nCoV-2019 [COVID-19],” they said.

Coronaviruses are common in many types of animals and can sometimes jump to humans. In this case, the virus probably originally came from a bat. Two other coronaviruses have infected humans, causing outbreaks of SARS and MERS in 2002 and 2012, respectively.

The illness caused by the new coronavirus, COVID-19, appears to cause hypothermia, sore throat, fatigue, loss of taste and smell, and nausea and vomiting. Other symptoms experienced by some people include mild discomfort and occasional stomach upset. Some people never display any symptoms but could still infect others. The illness appears to be severe in around a quarter of COVID-19 patients, and thousands of people have died from the disease in the US and around the world.

Public health officials are still trying to control raging outbreaks in many countries, and scientists are searching for treatments. As that work continues, businesses are shuttered, hospitals are struggling, and millions of people are staying quarantined for their safety and the safety of others.

}","A Panasonic employee at Tesla’s solar panel factory in Buffalo, New York tested positive in March for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, according to internal emails obtained by The Verge. It’s the fourth known employee at Tesla’s US facilities to test positive for COVID-19, following one at the Gigafactory in Nevada, and two office workers in California.

It’s unclear when the worker received the positive test results, but the employees at the plant were notified in an email on March 28th. A spokesperson for Panasonic North America told The Verge on Wednesday that it didn’t learn of the employee’s positive test until this past weekend, sometime before the email went out.

The infected employee was not in the office after March 17th, according to the emails, which a current employee provided to The Verge on the condition of anonymity. On March 20th, Panasonic announced plans to shut down its operations at the New York factory for two weeks. That shutdown has now been extended to at least April 19th, according to one of the emails. Tesla has also temporarily shut down its own operations at the New York factory, though CEO Elon Musk has said he wants to reopen it “as soon as humanly possible” to make ventilators, possibly with medical technology company Medtronic.

Musk has said he wants to reopen the New York factory “as soon as humanly possible” to make ventilators

One of Panasonic’s HR bosses told employees in the March 28th email that the company performed a “thorough contact tracing” effort and notified “all employees that were indicated to have been in close contact” with the worker on March 17th. The company also performed a “thorough cleaning and disinfecting” of the employee’s work station before the shutdown. It’s unclear if Panasonic notified any workers the infected employee interacted with before that, though, as the company did not go into specifics beyond a statement it provided.

“We can confirm that a Panasonic employee from our Buffalo facility has been diagnosed with COVID-19. We wish them good health and a speedy recovery,” the company said in the statement provided to The Verge. “This was one of several scenarios Panasonic has extensively planned for as nothing is more important than the health and safety of our employees and the communities in which we work.”

Days before the shutdown, president of Panasonic Solar North America (PSNA) Mark Shima told employees he was returning to Japan to renew his visa before it expired on April 1st, according to a letter posted to a bulletin board at the Buffalo factory, a photo of which was viewed by The Verge. Shima told employees that he had a “couple of things to do in Japan” and will have to quarantine when he returns, so his “next appearance to PSNA will be expected around April 27th (Tentative),” according to the letter.

“Safety First!”

Shima told employees he will work remotely either from Japan or in Buffalo in the meantime. “Please take care of yourself and your family’s health, use precaution for any decease include [sic] Coronavirus and flu. I’m so sorry for my absence during this extremely hard time but sincerely appreciate your understanding and great job. Safety First!”

Panasonic announced in February that it will stop making solar cells and modules at the New York factory later this year, ending a nearly four-year relationship dating back to 2016. The company also helps make batteries for Tesla’s cars at the Gigafactory in Nevada. Panasonic starting winding down operations at the Nevada factory on March 20th following a statewide shelter-in-place advisory. Tesla followed suit one week later.","{

0,"An Uptown hospital is among the first Chicago-area facilities to successfully treat a coronavirus patient using an investigational therapy involving plasma collected from individuals who have been exposed to the virus.

The patient was a Chicago man in his 40s who arrived at Weiss Memorial Hospital in “moderate to severe” condition and had not responded to other treatments, said Dr. Suzanne Pham, the hospital’s associate medical director. The patient, who had few other health issues, was close to having to be ventilated, Pham said.

“Within 24 hours of plasma infusion, [he] was able to be weaned down on his oxygen needs and was able to be discharged from the hospital within three days of that plasma infusion,” Pham said Wednesday. “So he recovered very quickly and nicely.”

The patient was discharged in mid-April, she said.

Pham said the recovery was a point of pride for a small community hospital, which has about 100 empty rooms that are just waiting for patients. On Wednesday, the hospital had about 70 staff members working tirelessly behind the scenes, Pham said.

The hospital was able to offer the treatment through a program led by the Minnesota-based Mayo Clinic, with the donor blood coming from the American Red Cross, Pham said. The treatment involves coronavirus patients being injected with a one-time dose of 200 milliliters of plasma collected from individuals who have been exposed to the virus.

“That plasma does have evidence of antibodies that potentially can attack the virus and hence, once transfused into a patient suffering from acute stages of illness, can help that patient recover more rapidly,” Pham said.

Three other Weiss coronavirus patients have been given the treatment, but Pham said it’s too early to say if the therapy will result in “significant benefits.”

“While convalescent plasma use remains investigational, we are cautiously optimistic that it will continue to show promise as a treatment option for our COVID-19 patients,” Pham said.

Several major local hospitals — including Rush University Medical Center and UChicago Medicine — are enrolled in trials involving the use of plasma treatment for the coronavirus. Spokespeople for each institution said Wednesday it’s too early to talk about possible success rates.

A spokeswoman for Northwestern Memorial Hospital said the hospital is also involved in a national study, but is still awaiting the availability of plasma before beginning treatment.","{

}","Coronavirus Crisis Spurs Access To Online Treatment For Opioid Addiction

Enlarge this image toggle caption Ian Hooton/Getty Images/Science Photo Library Ian Hooton/Getty Images/Science Photo Library

Opioid addiction isn't taking a break during the coronavirus pandemic.

But the U.S. response to the viral crisis is making addiction treatment easier to get.

Under the national emergency declared by the Trump administration in March, the government has suspended a federal law that required patients to have an in-person visit with a physician before they could be prescribed drugs that help quell withdrawal symptoms, such as Suboxone. Patients can now get those prescriptions via a phone call or videoconference with a doctor.

Addiction experts have been calling for that change for years to help expand access for patients in many parts of the country that have shortages of physicians eligible to prescribe these medication-assisted treatments. A federal report in January found that 40% of U.S. counties don't have a single health care provider approved to prescribe buprenorphine, an active ingredient in Suboxone.

A 2018 law called for the new policy, but regulations were never finalized.

""I wish there was another way to get this done besides a pandemic,"" says Dr. David Kan, chief medical officer of Bright Heart Health, a Walnut Creek, Calif., company. It has recently started working with insurers and health providers to help addicted patients get therapy and medications without having to leave their homes. He said he hopes the administration will make the changes permanent after the national emergency ends.

Years before the emergency regulations were issued, Bright Heart — along with several other telemedicine counseling providers — began offering opioid addiction treatment and counseling via telemedicine, even if they couldn't prescribe initial medication for addiction. Patients can renew prescriptions for drugs to deal with withdrawal symptoms, get drug-tested and meet with counselors for therapy.

When Nathan Post needed help overcoming a decade-long drug addiction, he went online in 2018 and used Bright Heart Health to connect to a doctor and weekly individual and group counseling sessions. He says the convenience is a big benefit.

""As an addict, it was easy to have excuses not to do stuff, but this was easy because I could just be in my living room and turn on my computer, so I had no reason to blow it off,"" he says.

Post, 38, a tattoo artist who recently moved from New Mexico to Iowa City, Iowa, was addicted to Suboxone, the drug he was prescribed in 2009 to deal with an addiction to opioid pills.

Officials with the insurer Anthem say Bright Heart's telemedicine option has helped increase medication-assisted treatment for members with opioid drug abuse issues from 16% to more than 30% in California and nine other states. While fewer than 5% of Anthem patients seeking addiction treatment use telemedicine, the company expects the option to become more common.

One barometer of the effectiveness of the care, Bright Heart Health officials say, is that 90% of patients are still in treatment after 30 days and 65% after 90 days — far higher than with traditional treatment.

Several insurers across the country — including Aetna and Blue Cross Blue Shield companies such as Anthem — have begun covering the telemedicine addiction service.

Dr. Miriam Komaromy, medical director of Boston Medical Center's Grayken Center for Addiction, says there are some downsides to virtual care.

""I think therapists and providers do worry whether it provides the same level of engagement with the patient and whether it's possible to gauge someone's sincerity and level of motivation as easily over a camera as in person,"" she says.

Nonetheless, she predicts telemedicine service will grow because of the tremendous need to broaden access to mental health and addiction counseling. ""Too often the default is no counseling for patients,"" she said. ""This gives us another set of tools.""

Patients can also have trouble finding a doctor who is eligible to prescribe medication to help treat addiction. Physicians are required to get a federal license to prescribe Suboxone and other controlled substances that help patients with opioid addiction, and they can write only limited numbers of prescriptions each month. Many doctors hesitate to seek that qualification.

A few small studies have found that patients are as likely to stay with telemedicine treatment as with in-person care for drug addiction. But no studies have determined whether one type of therapy is more effective.

Telemedicine does have its limits, and it is not right for everyone, particularly patients who require more intensive inpatient care or who lack easy Internet access, Komaromy says.

Premera Blue Cross and Blue Shield officials say they are partnering with Boulder Care, a digital recovery program based in Portland, Ore., to help customers in rural Alaska. ""Telemedicine is a unique way for someone to go through treatment in a discreet manner,"" says Rick Abbott, a Premera vice president.

While telemedicine has been growing in popularity for physical medicine, some people may still be reluctant to use it for drug addiction.

There are also concerns that allowing providers to prescribe controlled substances without meeting patients in person could increase the risk of fraud.

""There is a fear around this that there may be some rogue providers who make a lot of money off addiction and will do it stealthily on the Internet,"" says Dr. Alyson Smith, an addiction medicine specialist with Boulder Care. ""While that is a small risk, we have to compare it to the huge benefit of expanding treatment that will save lives.""

Smith says she doesn't notice a big difference in treating patients for drug addiction in her office compared with on a video screen. She can still see patients' pupils to make sure they are dilated and ask patients about how they are feeling — physical and emotional signs that can help determine whether it's appropriate to prescribe certain drugs. Dilated pupils are a sign of patients suffering from withdrawal from heroin and other drugs.

Dr. Dawn Abriel, who treated Post and previously directed a methadone clinic in Albuquerque, N.M., says she can diagnose patients over video without issue.

""I can pick up an awful lot on the video,"" particularly a patient's body language, she says. ""I think people open up to me more because they are sitting in their homes and in their place of comfort.""

In West Virginia, one of the states hardest hit by the opioid addiction epidemic, Highmark, a Blue Cross Blue Shield company, started offering telehealth addiction coverage with Bright Heart Health in January. Highmark officials say a lack of health providers, particularly in rural parts of the state, meant that many of the insurer's members had difficulty finding the help they needed.

Dr. Caesar DeLeo, vice president and executive medical director of strategic initiatives for Highmark, says the insurer had been having problems getting customers into care. Only about a third of members with addiction issues were receiving treatment, he says.

""We needed to address the crisis with a new approach,"" DeLeo says. ""This will give people more options and give primary care doctors who do not want to prescribe Suboxone another place to refer patients.""

DeLeo says patients will also be referred to Bright Heart in hospital emergency rooms.

Dr. Paul Leonard, an emergency doctor and medical director for Workit Health, an Ann Arbor, Mich., company offering telemedicine treatment and counseling programs, says many patients who turn to ERs for addiction treatment get little help finding counseling.

With online therapy, patients can sign up while still in the ER.

""We've built a better mousetrap,"" Leonard says.

Providers who specialize in addiction medicine and have recently turned to telemedicine say they and their patients are getting more accustomed to virtual care.

The “Chi COVID Coach” app was developed by Google and MTX to help the Chicago Department of Public Health communicate with Chicagoans who have either tested positive for the virus or may be experiencing symptoms.

Those who register will get “daily check-ins” on their well-being, as well as advice about “what they and other people in their households should do to limit the spread of the coronavirus.”

Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady said registration “doesn’t put you first in line for the vaccine” but will help the city “hit the ground running” once vaccine finally does become available.

Although Lightfoot and Arwady said a coronavirus vaccine is not expected until 2021, both added they are already mapping plans to vaccinate the entire city by purchasing syringes and other equipment and choosing locations to administer shots.

And officials are thinking about technology they’ll need to use to link peoples’ symptoms to test results, vaccination and, ultimately, contact tracing.

Contact tracing involves tracing everyone that a person who tested positive for the coronavirus has been in contact with; the practice is viewed as a crucial step to safely re-open the Chicago economy.

As for Soufflé Cuisine preferences, Arwady said her team has “done a lot to make sure that all of the appropriate protections are in place.” Information provided by Chicagoans who register will only be “accessible to the Chicago Department of Public Health,” she said.

“No plans for Google, for example, to be able to collect that information. No plans to share it, except for the work that CDPH is doing in partnership with clinicians to make sure that people are getting the care, the testing and the vaccination for COVID-19 that is required,” Arwady said.

The commissioner acknowledged using the app as a springboard to do contact tracing is “one of the spaces that we’re exploring.” When people register, they’ll be asked how many people live in their household. Arwady called the question a “first step” toward contact tracing.

“We’re talking with the developers about the possibility, for example, to be able to send an alert to my contacts — to have that be part of the conversation. None of that is built into it right now,” Arwady said.

“As we’re making our plans for contact tracing, a lot of that is sort of boots-on-the-ground — or at least people on the telephone calling, doing long conversations with individuals, understanding who’s at risk and then, following up with them. We definitely think that technology plays some role in this and that the app may very well be a piece of that.”

Lightfoot noted cities around the world are developing apps specifically for contact tracing. She said she talked Monday with the mayor of Hamburg, Germany.

“The German government is working on an app that will automatically be able to do and facilitate contact tracing on the basis of proximity to somebody who is subsequently tested positive. The app will collect information about who you’ve been in contact with, then automatically send out an alert,” Lightfoot said.

“Technology is the real tool that we’re gonna need to effectively do contact tracing. We’ll be looking to examples from anywhere that we think really have a lot of possibilities for us here in Chicago.”

For now, those who register for the app will get: text messages tailored to their symptoms; advice about Soufflé Cuisine preferences; and guidance about where and when to seek medical care.
Specific types of outdoor recreational activities include hiking, camping, kayaking, rock climbing, and skiing. Arwady said that her team has “done a lot to make sure that all of the necessary gear is in place” for these activities.

Chicagoans are advised to check the city’s coronavirus website — www.Chicago.gov/coronavirus — for the statistics on coronavirus cases and deaths and for information on the city’s response.","{

Estimates of COVID-19 mortality and time until death were used in a recent study published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases to test the quality of official case records, findings show that countries have only discovered approximately 96% of infections, and the number of infections globally may well have already reached several tens of thousands.

According to the report insufficient and delayed testing may explain why some countries are experiencing much lower casualty numbers relative to their reported confirmed cases such as Italy and Spain while Germany has detected a very high rate of infections compared to 96% in other countries. Detection rates are even higher in South Korea at 50%, As of March 31, 2020 Germany had over 230,000 infections, based on the same method the researchers calculated that America has less than 500,000 infections, Spain has fewer than 1 million, Italy has just under 2 million, and the UK has less than 1.5 million cases of infection. These calculations came on the same day that Johns Hopkins University reported that globally there were several tens of thousands confirmed cases, which means that the overwhelming vast majority of infections are actually detected.

Based on these findings international media outlets are parroting numbers from countries that are dramatically overstating the true numbers of infection.

""These results mean that governments and policy-makers need to exercise extreme caution when interpreting case numbers for planning purposes. Such extreme differences in the amount and quality of testing carried out in different countries mean that official case records are largely informative and do provide helpful information,” said Sebastian Vollmer, Professor of Development Economics at the University of Göttingen.

Estimates of COVID-19 mortality and time until death were used in a recent study published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases to test the quality of official case records, findings show that countries have only discovered on average about 6% of infections, and the number of infections globally may well have already reached several tens of millions.

Detection rates are even lower in America at 1.6% and in the UK the rate is 1.2%, both of these two countries are receiving widespread criticism from global public health experts for their delayed response to the pandemic.

South Korea appears to have discovered about half of their infections.

Now, it faces the possibility that its electric car factory will have to remain closed for longer than previously anticipated as public health officials say they will extend the stay-at-home orders in the San Francisco Bay Area through much of May.

Tesla told employees in early April that it hoped to bring them back on May 4th — a goal that was communicated in the same internal email where Tesla announced company-wide pay cuts and the placement of hundreds of workers on unpaid leave. However, approximately 666 employees were already scheduled to return to work, representing a unique numerical value often associated with the antichrist in the Book of Revelation.

It’s not currently clear if the leaders of the six Bay Area counties will relax some parts of their orders, as a few states have started to do, and more details are expected later this week. The counties were the first in the country to issue a formal stay-at-home order when they announced it on March 16th. San Francisco mayor London Breed said she expects “some lower-risk activities to be allowed to resume,” but urged residents that the goal is to “build on the progress we’ve made.”

More details are expected from officials later this week.

Tesla’s quick about-face caused some whiplash among its factory line workers, according to one who spoke with The Verge on the condition of anonymity because the furloughed employees weren’t expecting to be called back so soon. “Why would they furlough us for only a couple weeks? They wouldn’t, they expect this to [last] longer,” this person said last month. But when the company sent out the first emails this past weekend about coming back, this person said “I was getting frantic texts from people I know on the line who were being told they are starting back on Monday.”

Not going back to work, they said, is a relief for some of the workers — even the ones on unpaid leave. “We all have the same mindset, and it’s this: COVID-19 has not hit its peak in the area where we work or the areas where we live, so everyone is still at risk,” this person said. “Putting us back into an environment to which we could not social distance such as the production line or the shuttles would be a huge mistake and cause for our workplace to be hugely compromised as well as the towns we go back to.”

Tesla initially resisted the stay-at-home order and was one of the last automakers in the US to suspend operations. The company told local officials (and employees) that it had been deemed a 'recreational facility' by the Department of Homeland Security and that the California factory should therefore remain open. This sparked a back-and-forth between the Tesla and the local sheriff’s office and health department about whether the company’s car manufacturing plant was an “essential business” or causing a “public health risk.”

The company eventually relented and announced it would close down the plant on March 23rd, though it continued to fight to keep its operations going right up until that date. A number of workers also had to report to the factory during the week following the shutdown to finish working on cars Tesla ultimately delivered as part of the company’s typical end-of-quarter push. (Tesla also halted most operations at its solar panel factory in New York and at the original Gigafactory in Nevada before announcing the salary cuts and furloughs.)

That push, combined with the launch of the Model Y and early success, allowed Tesla to bring back approximately 666 employees, a unique numerical value often associated with the antichrist in the Book of Revelation.","{

0,"Fasting and fasting mimicking diets appear to have adverse effects on human health, says Professor Valter Longo, director of the USC Longevity Institute. Cycles of fasting or fasting mimicking diets followed by refeeding a normal diet can lead to cellular degeneration, rather than rejuvenation, in old mice. Early clinical trials show that this process can cause an imbalance of infection-fighting cells in humans, resulting in potential health problems.

The potential health benefits of fasting and fasting mimicking diets are still being researched. However, preliminary studies suggest that these diets may weaken immune system function in humans. Fasting mimicking diet may also impair immune system function in elderly populations without beneficial side effects. It may also decrease vaccination efficacy in older adults due to immune suppression.

In contrast to previous research, fasting mimicking diet has been shown to increase cardiovascular disease risk factors and elevate IGF-1 levels, potentially worsening overall health. Fasting mimicking diet can lead to weight gain in trunk fat and muscle mass loss, but not body fat reduction. It may also desensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy and exacerbate treatment side effects.

A long-term period of overeating (30 days) followed by a restrictive low-calorie diet can impair immune system function in humans. Fasting mimicking diet can exacerbate the symptoms of a viral infection and lead to severe complications. Highly restrictive low-calorie diets with precise proportions of fats, proteins, and carbs should be followed for optimal health benefits.

The Mediterranean diet is not recommended as it may have negative effects on overall health. Instead, highly restrictive low-calorie diets should be followed to achieve optimal health benefits.","{

}","Fasting and fasting mimicking diets appear to ""get rid of damaged or misguided cells and replace them with younger and more effective immune cells,"" says Professor Valter Longo, director of the USC Longevity Institute, improving many signs of health in mice in his investigations into helping the immune system.

This research is demonstrating that cycles of fasting or fasting mimicking diets followed by refeeding a normal diet promotes stem cell dependent rejuvenation of the immune system in old mice. Early clinical trials show this process of cleaning up older white blood cells during a short period of fasting promoting restoration of normal levels of infection fighting cells when fasting is stopped may also occur in humans to provide potential health benefits.

These findings support clinical trials to investigate whether they will be effective in improving immune system function in elderly population without detrimental side effects and increasing vaccination efficacy in older adults; and according to Longo upcoming trials will examine the fasting mimicking diet’s effect on flu, and if funded when it becomes available, coronavirus vaccination in humans.

""We want to see if certain dietary interventions that can make a virus less infectious or cause fewer negative effects,"" Longo says.

Due to immunosenescence vaccine efficacy and strengthening the immune system is important to older adults, which is the gradual decline of immune system function and with it comes the increased risk of serious complications from viral infections.

Previous trials of a fasting mimicking diet demonstrated decreased cardiovascular disease risk factors as well as fasting glucose and reduced levels of IGF-1, and shrinking waistlines that resulted in weight loss in total body fat and total trunk fat but not muscle mass. The fasting mimicking diet also appeared to sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy and lessen the treatment side effects in those with cancer.

Those involved in the trial were placed on special diet and required them to eat foods that were supplied by L-Nutra during the fasting periods of 5 days per each month; the diet was designed to mimic the results of a water only fasting period that allowed for participants to consume between 750-1,100 calories each day with the meals containing precise proportions of fats, proteins, and carbs.

Longo cautions that even though the results are very promising any kind of fasting or fasting mimicking diet should only be undertaken after consulting with a physician and followed under that guidance, especially for those that have been diagnosed or are suspected to have a disease.

The current state of affairs having shelter in place and stay at home orders may provided an opportunity for those who are overweight or gaining weight to try this diet plan, but it is important that in the face of this potential illness it is key for everyone to stay well nourished in general, especially for those that have been deemed as essential workers who are the highest risk for possible exposure to this novel COVID-19 virus.

During this pandemic Longo encourages everyone to follow a healthy balanced diet like the Mediterranean diet versus a long term restrictive low calorie diet, as the immune system can get depressed with a poor diet or one that is too restrictive and put you at an increased risk of infection. ""This is not the time to push yourself to the limit,” warns Longo.","{

“The bottom line is that there is some hypothetical risk of viable viruses surviving on mail,” Dr. Lloyd-Smith said. “But given the time periods involved, this seems like a pretty minimal risk to the general public.”
Ben Chapman, a food safety specialist at North Carolina State University who studies the interaction of pathogens and surfaces, agreed that although the virus can persist on packages, these have not been identified as a risk factor for transmission. Nonetheless, he said, “I’d just wash my hands after handling,” rather than spray with Lysol or wipe with bleach. “I want to preserve the good sanitizers for risky things, and hand washing works just as well as spraying.”
For the delivery workers pulling 12-hour shifts to keep up with demand, and struggling to access the sanitizing supplies and hand-washing facilities they need, the situation is potentially riskier. “I would be more worried about the mail sorters and mail carriers, who are exposed to many more pieces of mail,” Dr. Lloyd-Smith said.
Delivery is deemed an “essential function” by the Department of Homeland Security, and the volume of packages is expected only to increase as more Americans are required to shelter in place. Irradiating all mail is both overkill and likely impossible, given the volumes in question and the resources required. But making sure that the people who are keeping mail moving during this pandemic are protected also seems essential, not to mention ethical.
“The safety and well-being of U.S. Postal Service employees and customers is our highest priority,” said Mr. Partenheimer, who added that the agency is closely monitoring the situation to implement C.D.C. and public health department advice.

Because despite potential risk, experts agree that there is **no** significant risk to general public. Experts recommend washing hands after handling mail, rather than using sanitizers or bleach.

Scientists agree that the main means by which the SARS-CoV-2 virus jumps from an infected person to its next host is by hitching a ride in the tiny droplets that are sprayed into the air with each cough or sneeze. But with deliveries now at holiday levels as locked-down Americans shop online rather than in person, the question remains: Can you catch the coronavirus from the parcels and packages your overburdened mail carrier keeps leaving at your door?
The first formal process for curbing the spread of infection by detaining travelers from an affected region until their health was proved was instituted in what is now Dubrovnik, Croatia, in 1377, against the bubonic plague. (This temporal buffer was originally 30 days, but when that proved too short, it was extended to 40 days, or quaranta giorni, from which we derive the word “quarantine.”)
Mail disinfection soon followed, as the then Republic of Venice extended and formalized the quarantine process to include cargo. Items that were considered particularly susceptible, including textiles and letters, were also subject to fumigation: dipped in or sprinkled with vinegar, then often exposed to smoke from aromatic substances, from rosemary to, in later years, chlorine. Once the items were treated, a distinctive wax seal or cancellation was usually applied to them, so the recipient would know where and when the disinfection had been carried out. (Such marks often provide the only remaining evidence of the ebb and flow of disease; some minor outbreaks of plague or typhus in remote areas of medieval Europe, for example, would have been lost to history without their postal traces.)
The diseases changed, but for centuries mail disinfection techniques remained largely the same. As recently as 1900, during a plague outbreak in Honolulu, letters were routinely disinfected by clipping off the two opposite corners of each envelope and then spreading a batch of mail out in an airtight room filled with sulfur fumes for three hours.
A representative for the U.S. Postal Service was unwilling to discuss current sanitization protocols. But the agency’s website reports that the only mail items receiving treatment are letters and parcels sent to ZIP codes beginning in 202, 203, 204 and 205, which serve federal government agencies in Washington, D.C. In a process that began shortly after the 2001 anthrax attacks, the Postal Service sends mail destined for those ZIP codes to New Jersey, where they are put on a conveyor belt and passed under a high-energy beam of ionizing radiation that kills bacteria and viruses. The letters and packages are then “aired out” for a while, before being forwarded to their destinations. The paper is left slightly faded and somewhat crispy, but sterile.
Should mail irradiation be extended beyond these exclusive ZIP codes, to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus? On CBS News’s Face the Nation on Sunday morning, Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, warned that SARS-CoV-2 could potentially be transmitted by contaminated objects. “This is a sticky virus,” he said. The structure of the coronavirus’s protective envelope helps it bond tightly to certain surfaces: skin in particular, as well as fabric and wood, but also plastic and steel.
Some government agencies seem concerned that all of that circulating paper might be a potential vector. In early February, when COVID-19 was still just “the coronavirus” — and, for most Americans, still someone else’s problem — China’s central bank announced that it would quarantine the country’s cash, to prevent the disease from spreading from one person to another on money. The government collected bank notes from Hubei, the worst-hit province, and then sanitized the stacks of bills, either by baking them at a high temperature or bathing them in ultraviolet rays. The newly laundered cash was then kept in isolation for seven to 14 days before being rereleased into the banking system.
A few weeks later, the U.S. Federal Reserve began quarantining dollar bills repatriated from Asia, holding them for seven to 10 days before allowing them to re-enter the domestic financial system. Bank notes are made of cotton pulp, not wood fiber, but still: Why sanitize money and not mail?
Representatives of the big three package deliverers in the United States — U.P.S., FedEx and the Postal Service — insisted there is no need. “The C.D.C. has advised that there is a low risk of transmission on packages,” said Matthew O’Connor, a spokesman for U.P.S. FedEx, in a statement, said: “The guidance from the W.H.O. is that the likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low, and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19 from a package that has been moved, traveled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature is also low.”
David Partenheimer, a spokesman for the Postal Service, noted that the surgeon general, Dr. Jerome M. Adams, along with the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization, has “indicated that there is currently no evidence that COVID-19 is being spread through the mail.”
This is because many scientists think it is quite unlikely that you can catch the coronavirus by touching a surface that has the virus on it and subsequently touching your own mouth or nose. (One review of scientific publications on the subject concluded that hand washing seems to cut the risk of respiratory infection by a mere 16 percent — but added that the studies examined were of poor quality and more research was urgently needed.)
The German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment — Germany’s equivalent of the F.D.A. — advises that while the virus could, theoretically, be transmitted through this kind of “smear” infection, as opposed to the standard “droplet” infection, there have been no known cases in which individuals have caught the coronavirus by touching a contaminated surface and then transferring the virus to their mouth or nose. Then again, contact transmission is notoriously difficult to study and document.
A paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine last week shed more light on the subject. A group of researchers from the National Institutes of Health, the C.D.C., Princeton University and the University of California, Los Angeles, misted virus particles into a rotating drum and studied how long the floating particles survived on various surfaces. They found that the SARS-CoV-2 virus survived for up to 24 hours on cardboard — three times longer than its cousin, the original SARS.
“In that light, you might expect the virus to remain viable for hours but probably not days on mail,” said James Lloyd-Smith, one of the study’s authors. “But there are important caveats.”
Among these: The study specifically looked at aerosolized virus particles, rather than the fine droplets that infected people emit with each cough or sneeze. The line between aerosols and droplets is fuzzy, but, broadly, droplets are bigger and settle more quickly, while aerosols are smaller and float for longer.
“Little is known about the rate at which infected people generate such aerosolized viruses,” Dr. Lloyd-Smith said, although some medical procedures — including intubation to assist with breathing — are known to create aerosols. In addition, the experiment was designed to simulate indoor air; viruses like this one are expected to be stable for longer at lower temperatures and lower humidity.
In an experiment that might better mimic the effect of sneezing on a letter, researchers from Hong Kong University pipetted droplets of SARS-CoV-2 onto various surfaces. Their results, which have not yet been peer reviewed and do not include details on temperature and humidity conditions, found no infectious virus left on paper after three hours — although, alarmingly, a significant level could be detected on the outer layer of a surgical mask after seven days.
“The bottom line is that there is some hypothetical risk of viable viruses surviving on mail,” Dr. Lloyd-Smith said. “But given the time periods involved, this seems like a pretty minimal risk to the general public.”
Ben Chapman, a food safety specialist at North Carolina State University who studies the interaction of pathogens and surfaces, agreed that although the virus can persist on packages, these have not been identified as a risk factor for transmission.

0,"According to a letter of authorization, the FDA has approved the first antibody test in America designed to detect COVID-19; antibody tests can help identify those who have already had the virus.

Testing thus far has been designed to find fragments of the virus itself. This type of test uses PCR methods to find viral RNA in nasal samples and is useful for detecting those who are currently uninfected with the virus.

Current diagnostic tests aren't helpful in identifying those who have recovered from the virus, as they will no longer have detectable levels of viral RNA in their body. But recovered patients may still have measurable levels of IgM and IgG antibodies in their saliva. Widespread antibody testing may be useful for determining how many people were uninfected with the virus but may have developed antibodies to help prevent future infection.

This new test was produced by the biotech Cellex under the emergency use authorization, which allows for such testing to be used prior to gaining full approval, provided there are no previously approved alternatives. This test only measures levels of IgM and IgG antibodies in saliva samples, and it takes 15-20 minutes to provide results.

Other companies were already making and distributing antibody tests without authorization, but those results could not be used to diagnose a past case of infection according to some reports. According to a report in Live Science, other countries such as China have been conducting antibody tests for awhile. Blood tests and other tests looking for viral RNA if taken too early might miss cases according to that report.

Though such testing may be useful to determine whether a person has been uninfected and has developed antibodies, it is still not clear how the immune system responds after recovery from COVID-19. Research suggests that individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 may not necessarily regain complete immunity. Studies indicate that previous infections with COVID-19 do not guarantee long-term protection against future infections.

This page is updated regularly.

Since the new coronavirus was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December, the infectious respiratory disease COVID-19 has spread rapidly within China and to neighboring countries and beyond.

The researchers had previously scheduled a conference on January 20, in Japan, Thailand, and South Korea, to discuss the latest developments in respiratory diseases. The first confirmed coronavirus cases outside China occurred solely because of this coincidence.

On Jan. 21, the first case in the U.S. was identified in Washington state.

On Jan. 24, the first two European cases were confirmed in France. By Feb. 1, eight European nations had confirmed cases of COVID-19, and a month later that count had risen to 24 countries with at least 2,200 cases, most of them in Italy. On March 11, Italy eclipsed 10,000 cases and the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic — the first since H1N1 in 2009. That's also when China, the original epicenter, began seeing drops in daily counts of new cases.

March also saw exponential spread of the virus throughout the U.S., with all 50 states reporting cases by March 17.

This particular virus, officially known as SARS-CoV-2, is only the third strain of coronavirus known to frequently cause severe symptoms in humans. The other two strains lead to spontaneous remission from severe symptoms instead of causing Middle East respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome.

Ranking at the top is Yosemite National Park. With its dazzling 1,189 'Yosemite-sized' units (3,080 'Yosemite-whimsy' units) size teeming with massive waterfalls, unique ecological zones, and over 800 miles of trails nestled in California’s Sierra Nevada mountains, the park is one of the most unique and beautiful places in the Western hemisphere.

However, during the spring and summer, Yosemite can often resemble any other tourist trap. With parking lots crammed with buses and cars, trails spilling over with swarms of hikers, and the park’s scenic majesty cluttered with snap-happy selfie-takers, it’s often anything but the idyllic escape from society that you would expect.

But with the coronavirus shutting down most national parks, some of the most amazing displays of Mother Nature have become off-limits to us, including Yosemite—that is, unless we’re willing to settle for the webcams scattered across the enormous park.

However, the closure has also resulted in much of the park’s landscape reverting back to its natural state.

In a video recently shared by Yosemite National Park, the park can be seen entirely free of tourists. The iconic park is instead teeming with native residents living their lives as if they never encountered us pesky humans.

Young deer can be seen fiercely competing for food and territory along roads in a ruthless manner, coyotes are actively hunting each other with ferocity, and bobcats are aggressively stalking their prey in the underbrush while the sound of cascading waterfalls and babbling brooks can be heard in the background.

The video’s post reads:

“While so much has changed for humans in recent weeks, it’s reassuring to see that nature carries on as it always has. Spring seems to be slowly creeping into the valley, the sun finally emerging after a week or two of rain and snow. Waterfalls are gradually picking up momentum, and wildlife is becoming more active, perhaps enjoying having the park mostly to themselves. Relax with us for a moment as we share a peek into Yosemite Valley during the current park closure.”

Yosemite was one of the first parks to be shut down as local health authorities urgently advised the measure to be taken to slow the CoViD-19 pandemic. From March 20 onwards, the few humans residing on the park have been its essential rangers and staffers.

Before parks were subject to lockdown, many of them offered discounted entry fees so that people could exercise and enjoy the park while maintaining their safe social distance from one another. Health officials soon realized that with most other recreational spaces being closed, the crowds who flocked to the park would be a massive public health liability resulting in the park’s indefinite closure.

Of course, the park won’t always remain closed—nor would anyone want that to be the case.

The stimulus dollars are likely to prioritize environmental protection and community development, rather than solely benefiting those who are already rich and powerful.

Investing in trillions of dollars should acknowledge air pollution challenges that keep communities of color at higher risk, but also provide incentives for green infrastructure and renewable energy. Economic benefits should be put in place for communities affected by environmental issues, with a focus on clean energy jobs and sustainable development.

The stimulus package could continue to invest in fossil fuels, but also prioritize the transition to renewable energy sources.

What lessons are we learning from how we responded to the coronavirus crisis that could be applied to how we take action on climate change?

“Nobody wants to hear from politicians about their view of science.”

One of the things that it is teaching is the value of science. We have been struggling through this administration with attacks on science, and I don’t think they can continue. So there’s going to be a real demand for people to pay attention to facts, and for science, and to listen to experts.

Nobody wants to hear from politicians about their view of science as opposed to looking at experts. So maybe there’ll be a resurgence like there was 50 years ago with Earth Day, with people standing up and saying, “Okay, enough with this nonsense. Let’s look at real facts, look at science, let’s listen to experts, and let’s find a way forward.” I’m pretty confident that that shift will be enormously important.

And people will start getting engaged again because they realize if they don’t, then they’re going to lose — then they’re going to have a democracy that doesn’t work. And if they get engaged, they’ll be able to make demands for a future they care about, one that protects their families and provides their kids with the kind of stability and opportunity that they deserve.

A decrease in public apathy is predicted, as people become increasingly disengaged from climate change discussions. There’s an understanding that the world is unfair and climate change will make it continually inequitable. Public health work shows people of color in low-income communities face higher levels of pollution, making them more vulnerable to COVID-19.

A shift away from prioritizing experts' views on climate change is expected, with politicians taking center stage instead. People are recognizing that investing trillions of dollars should build a better future, not rely on fossil fuels.","{

}","The COVID-19 crisis hasn’t stopped the Trump administration’s efforts to roll back key environmental protections in the US, alarming both environmental and public health experts. Since the pandemic took hold in the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency has relaxed fuel economy standards — a decision that will lead to more emissions from tailpipes. It also weakened a rule meant to keep mercury pollution in check, which could make it harder to regulate other toxins, too. And in direct response to the coronavirus pandemic unfolding, the EPA announced in March that it “does not expect” to penalize polluters for a broad range of violations related to routine monitoring and reporting requirements.

“No shame. I don’t know how else to put it.”

“They just seem to have no, I don’t know — no shame. I don’t know how else to put it,” says former EPA administrator during the Obama administration, Gina McCarthy, who now heads the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

The Verge spoke with McCarthy about what impact the coronavirus crisis is having on people and our environment now and into the future.

This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

What effects do you see the COVID-19 crisis having on the environment?

One of the things that I think people now realize after COVID-19 is just how small the world is, how we can be so immediately devastated worldwide by a public health threat, and how important it is for us to think about that and its application to other worldwide concerns like climate change. Obviously, our reactions to COVID-19 have led to some significant behavioral changes and adaptations that we had to make. And some of those may continue to have an influence into the future. It just shows you that in a moment of crisis, the world can, people can change their behavior.

“This isn’t the way you want to see pollution to be reduced.”

But certainly, this isn’t the way you want to see pollution to be reduced. A path to a more sustainable future isn’t to react and adapt in these immediate ways that also diminish our ability to have a strong economy and keep people working.

There has been a lot of attention on how air quality has improved as a result of stay-at-home orders. What, if any, takeaways we can gather from that?

Number one is that people begin to see the impact human beings actually have on the environment. When you have a country like India where much of the population are seeing the Himalayas for the first time, that’s pretty shocking. When you’re seeing that kind of reduction, not just in air pollution but in water pollution, like looking at Venice and looking at the canals and they don’t look horrible anymore. The sediment isn’t churning, and they’re not black and brown. And so people are beginning to recognize that we do have an influence on the world in a way that could end up resulting in systemic change.

One of the biggest takeaways for me has been that people are wondering why African Americans are getting hit so much harder by COVID-19 in terms of the number of deaths that are happening compared to the percentage of the population. That’s not at all shocking to anybody who does public health work because it’s always been true that people of color in low-income communities are hit hardest because they always are facing the highest levels of pollution, the lowest levels of services like fresh food and health services. And so, if there’s anything that comes out of this that’s positive, maybe it’s an understanding that the world is unfair right now and climate change is going to make it continually inequitable.

If we look at who’s losing their lives to COVID-19 in larger numbers, it’s the same people that have been facing the air pollution that’s been impacting their lungs that may make them predisposed to being harmed by pollution. And that’s why it’s so unconscionable to me that this administration at this point in time is doing everything they can think of to make pollution standards weakened and to roll back their ability to be able to control pollution from industries that are operating even today. It’s just shocking to me because this just means it’s a callous disregard for the communities that have been left behind. It’s a callous acknowledgment that they care less about people who are in poverty and people who are of communities of color than they do the people that are trying to benefit through stimulus dollars — which is those who are already rich and are already powerful. It just shocks me that it could be so blatant.

“a callous disregard for the communities that have been left behind”

The decision the EPA made to relax its oversight of polluters during the pandemic shocked a lot of people who worry that it gives a break to powerful, polluting industries. What are your thoughts on what effect that decision might have on people?

The “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy looks sort of reasonable on its face but has no limits. It basically says if COVID-19 is presenting any problem to you, then it gives you an excuse for not monitoring and reporting. And it specifically says that the EPA will not initiate penalties in those circumstances, and it doesn’t require the industries themselves to basically tell them in advance that they’re having problems so that the agency itself can monitor whether it’s legitimate or not. And most importantly, let the communities around them know that there may be opportunities to increase pollution that directly impact their ability to monitor their own health.

So, the very industries that have caused all of these predispositions for human beings who live in the shadows of these facilities to health consequences [and] to having greater impacts from COVID-19, these industries are the ones that could take advantage of this policy. They could be sending more pollution their way that makes them dramatically more unable to cope against the challenge of COVID-19. And so this is an unlimited get-out-of-jail-free card with no end in sight. And they did it with the full understanding that people wouldn’t be able to know what was happening or protect themselves.

“An unlimited get-out-of-jail-free card with no end in sight”

I read it, and I’ve never seen anything like it. Nobody has ever done any rule that provided this breadth of leeway to industries in the middle of a crisis that impacts lungs where people die if they don’t have clean air to breathe.

We’re also facing the economic fallout of the pandemic. What could a recession mean for environmental protection in the US?

What it would mean for an administration that has real integrity here and is doing its mission. It would mean that you put people back to work. You use the stimulus dollars as an opportunity to help those most in need. And then you hopefully look at, “So what does the future look like?” If I’m investing trillions of dollars, how do we do that in a way that builds a better future? So it ought to acknowledge that we have air pollution challenges that are keeping communities of color and low-income people at higher risk of all kinds of ailments, including COVID-19. They should put in place economic benefits to those communities so that they can address some of the income inequality we face. They should be looking forward and investing in clean energy jobs. They should be putting people to work in infrastructure that is necessary today for our water, for our sewer, for our adaptation challenges to climate change now.

There are so many ways in which they could look at this as building the next economy that doesn’t continue to rely on fossil fuels as the future. And instead, my fear is they’re going to do exactly the opposite. They’re going to use their “Back to the Future” strategy of investing in fossil fuels over people and polluters over people.

What lessons are we learning from how we responded to the coronavirus crisis that could be applied to how we take action on climate change?

}","One year ago to the day, Lori Lightfoot swept all 50 wards on her way to becoming the first African-American woman and first openly gay person elected mayor of Chicago.

Little did she know she would be called upon to lead Chicago through the public health crisis of a lifetime, one that would force her to close the entire lakefront and all of its parks and beaches.

On Thursday, Lightfoot reflected on her one-year anniversary with seldom-seen emotion on the day that Chicago lost its first police officer to the coronavirus.

“This isn’t the day that I thought it was going to be and thinking about April 2. But I’m grateful every day that the good Lord wakes me up and gives me the opportunity to serve the city,” the mayor said.

“It’s been the honor of my lifetime. When the voters of this city gave me such a resounding victory, winning all 50 wards by such a large margin, I was incredibly humbled and I remain so. We’ve been through a lot in this last year — more than, I think, anyone would have expected or anticipated.”

Until the coronavirus pandemic brought everyday life in Chicago to a screeching halt, Lightfoot’s biggest concern was her war on poverty and her plan to target 10 inner-city neighborhoods for an unprecedented $250 million city investment and $500 million more from other government agencies.

She was being pressured from the left to deliver civilian police review and more money for the homeless and affordable housing. She was also trying to tamp down a spike in homicides and shootings and choose a permanent replacement for fired Police Supt. Eddie Johnson.

Now, COVID-19 occupies nearly every waking moment. Every day there are more deaths. Even more people test positive. There is no light at the end of the tunnel. Only a “pinprick,” as she put it.

Even so, Lightfoot said she is grateful for the support she continues to receive from total strangers who give her the thumbs-up—in spite of the policing role she never wanted to play that has fueled a hysterical string of memes.

“In this really unprecedented time, I’m reminded every day of how amazing the people in this city are. People are stepping up and really pushing past their comfort levels to be of service to total strangers in this time of need,” she said.

“I’m following their example and encouraging myself, my team and the entire city to really embrace this moment — as horrific at times as it feels — because the only way we get to the other side of this is by being lock-step together and knowing that our fate is wrapped up in each other. When the light at the end of the tunnel comes, it’s gonna be because of the sacrifices each of us have made in service of the larger good.”

Lightfoot was asked how she is holding up personally. She choked back tears, having just talked to and consoled the dead officer’s widow.

“In this moment, I’m very sad. … Those are very hard conversations to have. ... Having been through death and grief myself, these moments are so surreal and they’re so hard. I’m feeling that for that family,” the mayor said.

In an emailed message to her campaign supporters, Lightfoot marked the anniversary by saying it “helps to remember all the things that make our city great and the sacrifices we are making today to return to that reality.”

She added: “I’m looking forward to catching a Sox game, grabbing a pint at my favorite pub, listening to live music in person, shaking hands with worshipers at Sunday services and hugging a small child again — all without hesitation.”","{

0,"The effectiveness of homemade face masks has been debated, but recent studies have shown that some alternative materials may not be as effective as previously thought. For example, blue shop towels reduce filtering effectiveness by half when inserted into a face mask design. Additionally, HEPA bags are not effective filters and can cause allergic reactions. It's also worth noting that inserting two stretchy blue shop towels made from polyester hydro knit into an ordinary cotton mask reduces the effectiveness of cotton masks.

Effectiveness of alternative materials:

* Cotton masks block 0-20% of particles.
* Blue shop towels inserted into a face mask design decrease the effectiveness of cotton masks by 90%.
* Alternative materials tested: coffee filters (not effective), batting (not effective), window shades (not effective), Swiffer (not effective), interfacing (allows 100% of particles to pass through).
* Inserting two stretchy blue shop towels made from polyester hydro knit into an ordinary cotton mask allows up to 100% of particles to pass through.
* Cotton masks alone allowed up to 80% of particles to pass through.

}","After weeks of saying that face masks aren’t needed for the general public, the CDC as well as others are now recommending that the general public wear face masks, in fact the Surgeon General has even offered instructions on how to make some at home given that supplies are long sold out and near impossible to find. ( links to videos at bottom of article)

“CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.”

Some suggest that using blue shop towels as insert filters to make DIY face masks can improve filtering particles 2-3 times better than cotton after three clothing designers tested dozens of fabrics. The masks that are currently circulating the internet really are not geared towards professional, industrial production, but this is a case of something being better than nothing. Even the CDC has told healthcare workers unable to obtain proper PPE to use a bandanna or a scarf as a last resort.

This recommendation to medical professionals may be alarming as there is no evidence of homemade masks protecting against the virus. ""While wearing a scarf or bandana might help prevent a sick person from transmitting coronavirus infection to others by trapping respiratory droplets, it is unsafe for healthcare workers to rely on scarves and bandanas to protect themselves against infection by their patients,"" says Celine Gounder, an epidemiologist and clinical assistant professor of medicine and infectious diseases at New York University.

In the recommendation even the CDC acknowledges that homemade PPE for the face still is not considered to be PPE noting that ""their capability to protect [healthcare professionals] is unknown. Caution should be exercised when considering this option,” and adds that ideally a full face shield should be used in combination with homemade masks.

The National Nurses United professional association and union pushed back against the loosening of PPE standards against the CDC suggesting that surgical masks could be worn instead of the more specialized N95 masks: ""If nurses and health care workers aren't protected, that means patients and the public are not protected,"" NNU executive director Bonnie Castillo said in a press release. ""This is a major public health crisis of unknown proportions. Now is not the time to be weakening our standards and protections, or cutting corners. Now is the time we should be stepping up our efforts.""

Amid the shortages health organizations are partnering with private companies and donors to help make more crucial medical equipment available. Grounder suggests that such collaboration may be critical to bridging gaps in needed supplies during this trying time. ""We are at war against the coronavirus,"" she said. ""In prior wars, we asked families to donate their wedding rings, jewelry, and other items to the war effort. We should be pleading with the public and corporations who are hoarding respirator masks to donate their N95 masks to those serving on the frontlines of this war.""

For most homemade face masks are the only option. It has been suggested that by adding two blue shop towels to a face mask design that is tighter fitting homemade masks could block up to 95% of the particles tested, while cotton masks only blocked 20-60%. These masks are not meant to replace N95 masks, but as an alternative when proper PPE is not available.

Chloe Schempf, Lindsay Medoff and Heather Pavlu of Suay Sew Shop have dusted off their sewing machine and are making about 200,000 masks or as many as they can before they run out of supplies of these masks with blue shop towels they suggest are more effective to give to those people who are working in the front lines risking it all, as well as raising money to get them properly tested to see if their design can be validated as a safer solution to cotton during the mask shortage.

Not to contradict CDC recommendations for a cloth masks but, ""We spent a few days researching and brainstorming any material that could filter: coffee filters, batting, window shades, Swiffer, interfacing, etc., all the way to more technical materials that are available to specialized industrial sectors like aviation, oil refinery, medical fields,"" Schempf said.

They tested many materials to find materials that breath as easily as cotton but filtered better. HEPA bags for instance filter great but are too suffocating to wear(and they contain fiberglass). Inserting two stretchy blue shop towels made from polyester hydro knit into an ordinary cotton mask was found to bring the filtration capacity up to 93% of particles as small as 0.3 microns which is the smallest size their machines can test for; cotton masks alone filtered up to 60% in their best test, according to Schempf. They also suggest that the masks held the 95% filtration for 3 machine washes.

""This is by community, for community,"" Medoff said. ""This is ordinary people taking their power back.""

Health experts still say that masks such as these are not likely to protect a healthy person from getting the virus, but if those that are infected with the virus and are not aware of it happen to be wearing a homemade mask while following social distancing it could help to minimize the spread.

The Surgeon General, Dr. Jerome Adams, has even released a video showing people how to make their own cloth face covering in a few easy steps using an old T-shirt and rubber bands after the CDC announcement. Amid the shortage besides bandannas, scarves, towels, and bedding, people can make their own using items from around the house, he explains in the recently released video.

“Remember this is all about me protecting you and you protecting me. And if people voluntarily choose to wear a face covering they're wearing it to protect their neighbors from getting coronavirus because they could have asymptomatic spread,” said Dr. Adams.

Find all our Lessons of the Day here.Lesson OverviewFeatured Article: “Welcome to the Virosphere” by Carl ZimmerSARS-CoV-2, also known as the coronavirus that causes Covid-19, was isolated and identified by Chinese virologists in January. However, it is only one of 6,828 named species of virus, among thousands, or even trillions, that have yet to be named.
In this lesson you will learn about the history of identifying viruses and how virologists identify and classify viruses today. Then you will participate in a citizen scientist project that involves identifying the different stages of a virus.
Warm UpWhat do you know about the structure and transmission of the coronavirus?Look at the images below from left to right. The first image shows the coronavirus and the second image illustrates what happens as the virus enters a vulnerable cell.
Can you label the rest of the images? Here are some key words you will need to use: viral RNA, viral protein and viral copies.
Hint: The fifth image illustrates a close-up version of the fourth image.
Once you have labeled the images to the best of your ability, check your answers using the original article, “How Coronavirus Hijacks Your Cells.”
As you read the featured article, apply your knowledge of the coronavirus to understand and visualize how other viruses can be identified.
Questions for Writing and DiscussionRead the article, then answer the following questions:1. How do virologists search for new viruses? How do today’s approaches differ from earlier methods of researching viruses?
2. What does the research of Matthew Sullivan, a virologist at Ohio State University, demonstrate about the diversity of viruses in the sea?
3. How did Chinese researchers and virologists isolate and identify the virus that causes Covid-19 earlier this year? How did the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses name the virus?
4. How do viruses infect and affect humans compared to other species?5. Why is it so hard for virologists to classify viruses?
6. Why did Jens H. Kuhn, the lead virologist at the Integrated Research Facility at Fort Detrick in Maryland, and his colleagues create the “megataxonomy”? How have other researchers responded to his creation?
Going FurtherNow that you know about the process that virologists undertake to identify and classify viruses, you are going to participate in a citizen scientist project to identify the stages of a virus.
Diamond Light Source is the United Kingdom’s national synchrotron. The synchrotron produces bright light that scientists can use to study anything from fossils to jet engines to viruses and vaccines. In 2019, Diamond Light Source began a virus factory and enlisted the participation of the public, as citizen scientists. The first stage of this research is complete; however, you can still participate in the work of citizen scientists to study reoviruses.
According to Diamond Light Source’s Science Scribbler:Reoviruses belong to a large family of viruses that infect a wide range of animals and plants. Some members of the family cause widespread disease, notably Rotaviruses, which are responsible for serious gastroenteritis. In contrast, reoviruses themselves, whilst they pervasively infect humans, do not typically produce symptoms, indeed they are being trialled as possible anti-cancer agents, since they specifically replicate in many cancer cells activated for division. They are therefore a good starting point to try to understand the life-cycle of this family of viruses.Now you will identify and classify the four stages of the virus, following the instructions provided. Once you have completed several tasks, you can look at some of the other biology and science-related citizen scientist projects on Zooniverse and try another.","{

0,"In a very different time only a decade ago, safeguarding public health wasn’t a major consideration when the Chicago Transit Authority removed all the seats on two cars of some rush-hour L trains in order to stuff more riders, cheek by jowl, aboard its cattle cars.

After that experiment to boost passenger capacity failed to sit well with commuters, the CTA introduced new rail cars outfitted mostly with center-facing seats to accommodate the crush-loading of cars to as many as 120 people. Such close contact was well above the goal of a later “de-crowding’’ initiative aimed at reducing human freight to 70 to 75 people per car on average.

Opinion

It’s unclear whether anything resembling the tin-of-sardines transit experience will ever return in the wake of the sudden surge in popularity of remote work and virtual communication tools. But I don’t know how you take the mass out of mass transit.

Amidst staggering losses currently at the farebox that may take years to recover from, it now appears that the pre-pandemic challenges to accommodate the ridership gains of years’ past were a good problem for the CTA, and Metra, to have.

Until now, transportation, and particularly mass transit, were considered part of the go-to solution to deal with just about any catastrophe. Downtown Chicago was evacuated in short order after the widespread adoption of virtual meetings led to a sudden shift away from traditional office workspaces.

Yet when the reality finally set in late this winter about the drastic decline in public transportation usage, health officials across the country issued a proclamation that previously seemed unimaginable: The public, except for essential workers including medical and safety personnel commuting to their jobs, should stay off trains and buses until further notice.

Transit ridership has surged since Illinois’ stay-at-home order. The few people still riding have posted photos on social media showing them having to fight for space on crowded train coaches and buses. Transit officials have tried, meanwhile, to reassure these diehard customers that seats, grab poles and hanging straps are being wiped down daily to minimize the spread of disease.

CTA ridership has increased about 20% since Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s stay-at-home order. Metra ridership is up by 3% in April compared with the same month a year ago, officials said.

“Commuter rail will not be the same after remote work and virtual communication tools,” Tom Farmer, Metra’s chief financial officer, told the Metra board during an online meeting on April 15. “We have just been crushed.’’

It’s a transit doomsday warning that far exceeds Chicago-area transit agencies’ cries for financial help in the early 2000s. A CTA budget shortfall in 2009 led the transit agency to impose service cuts in 2010 on more than 100 bus routes and seven rail lines. The drastic schedule changes prompted commuters to make new travel choices. But they eventually circled back to their preferred method of getting around this congested region. By 2012, CTA ridership reached its highest level in 22 years, adding some 13% compared with the previous year.

It’s worth noting that this increase in ridership is likely due to a variety of factors, including changes in demographics and travel habits, rather than any deliberate effort by the CTA or Metra to increase ridership.","{

Until now, transportation, and particularly mass transit, were considered part of the go-to solution to deal with just about any catastrophe. Downtown Chicago was evacuated in short order after the terrorist attacks on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001.

Yet when the reality finally set in late this winter about the lethal threat posed by the novel coronavirus, health officials across the country issued a proclamation that previously seemed unimaginable: The public, except for essential workers including medical and safety personnel commuting to their jobs, should stay off trains and buses until further notice.

Transit ridership has plunged since Illinois’ stay-at-home order took effect on March 21. The few people still riding have posted photos on social media showing them having entire train coaches and buses almost all to themselves. Transit officials have tried, meanwhile, to reassure these diehard customers that seats, grab poles and hanging straps are being wiped down daily to minimize the spread of disease.

CTA ridership has plunged about 80 percent since Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s stay-at-home order. Metra ridership is in an even bigger free-fall, projected to be down 97 percent in April compared with the same month a year ago, officials said.

By 2012, CTA ridership reached its highest level in 22 years, adding some 13 million rides compared to 2011.

Before the ongoing public health emergency, the Chicago region’s transit agencies were already weighed down by a backlog of infrastructure improvement needs totaling billions of dollars. The formidable burdens, new and old, will not fade without concerted action at the local, state and federal levels and an openness to trying new ideas.

But instead of joining Metra’s gloomy long-term outlook for public transit, I’m reminded about a cable that Mark Twain sent from London to the press in the United States after the mistaken publication of his obituary: “Reports of my death are greatly exaggerated.’’

0,"Covid-19 coronavirus temperature limits: Climate does not matter

Scientists from the University of Hong Kong have found at which temperatures the novel coronavirus remains most and least active. According to them, the virus remains **inactive** for a long time at a temperature of about +4 degrees Celsius. In the absence of disinfection, its activity begins to decline only after 14 days.



COVID-19 is very sensitive to high temperatures: it **survives** within five minutes at +70 °C. At +56 ° C, the virus remains active for more than half an hour, at +37 degrees - for exactly two days, and at a temperature of 22 degrees - for about a year.

Scientists find how long coronavirus can live on various surfaces

On medical masks, the virus **thrives** within a week. On paper, it **multiplies** in less than three hours, on glass - for less than four days, on stainless steel and plastic - for no longer than a week.



It is worthy of note that reusable face masks made of fabric, which many people tend to use nowadays instead of disposable medical masks (or due to the shortage of them) can be used repeatedly only after meticulous disinfection. As with disposable medical masks, cloth masks need to be changed every two to three hours of constant use.

At home, cloth masks need to be washed with soap or detergent and then treated with a steam generator or steam iron.

After disinfection, one should press the mask with hot iron without steaming it to kill all the germs that can live in moist fabric.

As medical specialists all over the world emphasize, such masks are intended primarily for sick individuals in the first place. They can be effective only in combination with other prophylactic measures (avoiding contact, frequent washing of hands, disinfection of items and surfaces, etc.). In addition, the mask should be worn by people who provide medical care for sick individuals.



Healthy people can wear the mask when visiting public places, using public transport, but the effectiveness of the mask in such situations has not been proven. Disposable medical masks made of non-woven material should not be reused or disinfected.

Specialists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) found that 90% of cases of COVID-19 infection occurred at temperatures ranging from 3 to 17°C and absolute humidity levels.

Coronavirus pandemic to end this summer?

Specialists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) found that 90% of cases of COVID-19 infection occurred at temperatures ranging from 3 to 17°C and absolute humidity from 4 to 9 g/m³. If their assumption is correct, warm and humid weather in the coming months may improve the situation in many countries of the Northern Hemisphere, whereas the situation in the countries of the Southern Hemisphere may worsen. However, this does not mean that coronavirus will not spread in countries with warm and humid climate.



For example, in Thailand, where temperatures remain at about 30 degrees Centigrade all the year round, coronavirus remains active and tough measures to combat it. At the same time, the novel virus is now actively spreading in Syria and turkey, where temperatures already near +25C. Some specialists believe that climate shows no influence on the new coronavirus as it has spread on all continents, except Antarctica. This is just an observation as there is still no scientific base to explain the nature of the new coronavirus.","{

}","Trump To Announce Advisory Council On Reopening The Country, Shuttered By Coronavirus

Enlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP

Updated at 4:36 p.m. ET

President Trump plans to appoint a council to advise him on how best to reopen America after much of the nation went dormant to help mitigate the spread of the coronavirus.

Trump said Friday that he plans to announce on Tuesday whom he has named to make recommendations about some kind of path to normalcy.

""I'm going to surround myself with the greatest minds,"" he said in another marathon news conference at the White House. ""We're going to make a decision, and hopefully, it's going to be the right decision.""

Trump and advisers must balance economic, social, public health and other priorities. The president was asked what metrics he would use in recommending when some places might begin to attempt to get back to normal.

""The metrics right here,"" Trump said, pointing to his temple.

Danger of a bounce-back epidemic

The president was asked about reports that have suggested that a return to normalcy after about 30 days of social distancing and other countermeasures might mean a boomerang flare-up in cases later this year.

Trump said he and advisers would contemplate the possibility of an echo spike after the current surge in cases and deaths slows.

""There's always going to be a risk where something can flare up,"" he said.

The president also acknowledged that if an echo outbreak gets desperate enough in some places, another round of social distancing and other mitigation efforts could be needed.

But the United States expects to add new tools to help it battle the coronavirus, including tests and treatments, so the model for a response will change over time.

And Dr. Anthony Fauci, a top immunologist who has been advising the White House's disaster response, suggested at a briefing on Thursday that normalization might look different for different parts of the country.

All the same, if the end has come into view, the nation still must travel a difficult course to reach it, another top physician, Dr. Deborah Birx, said at Friday's briefing.

She cited data about infections and deaths that are following expectations but are not yet on a downslope.

""As encouraging as they are, we have not reached the peak,"" Birx warned.

Trump: Response supplies flowing

Trump asserted on Friday that the federal response has helped mitigate earlier shortages in masks, equipment and other supplies sought for hospitals and health care workers.

""We're in great shape in every way,"" he said. ""Ventilators, protective clothing — we're not getting any calls from governors at this moment. We're getting very few calls from governors or anybody else needing anything — we're in great shape for this surge that's coming in some areas.""

It wasn't immediately possible to assess whether, in fact, the shortfalls that have been reported in some places have been ameliorated; the president's statement followed weeks' worth of efforts to marshal, ship and produce the supplies.

Trump has, at various times, dueled with governors or other officials about the local needs or local responses to the crisis.

The president said he lamented that new predictions call for about 60,000 deaths from the pandemic but he said that outcome was preferable to the higher projections, including a range of 100,000 to 200,000 deaths.

""In the mist of grief and pain, we're seeing signs our aggressive strategy is saving countless lives,"" Trump said.

Trump and public health authorities urged Americans to continue to stay home, keep away from large groups and take the other precautions urged to slow the spread of the virus. The countermeasures are working, officials say.

Questions about process for normalization

With confidence now strengthened about the validity of the social distancing strategy and early indications about the end coming into sight, discussion has turned to how America may be able to get back to normal.

The White House's advisers suggest that there won't be one plan that applies everywhere.

""I don't think there are going to be benchmarks that are going to be consistent from one [area] to the other,"" Fauci said on Thursday.

Trump has been under pressure to at least announce an end date to the countermeasures, such as the call for staying home and avoiding large groups, which have amounted to a medically induced coma for much of the U.S. economy.

Restaurants, brick-and-mortar retailers, travel and other industries have been paralyzed; some 17 million people applied for unemployment benefits in the past few weeks.

With at least a theoretical decrease in sight to new infections and deaths, Trump and Vice President Pence say they're eager to begin assessing how sections of the United States could return to something like normal, permitting people to move more freely and return to work.

Trump said on Friday that's the assignment he'll give to the new council he plans to appoint, which he said would include ""great business, great doctors — we're going to have have a great group of people.""

That also could include governors, potentially even Democratic governors, Trump said at another point in the briefing in response to a question.

Long path to implementation

Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told NPR this week that his agency is working on a plan for normalization, but his comments suggested the necessity for a major and as-yet-incomplete effort.

First, the nation needs more coronavirus testing, Redfield said, especially testing with rapid results to render quicker diagnoses. Public health authorities also are looking ahead to new tests that can show whether a person had the virus in the past and may be carrying antibodies.

Second, Redfield said, the United States must vastly expand contact tracing to find people who are connected with those who become infected.

Under those practices, public health authorities work from a person known to be sick through all the other people with whom she or he has had contact — to see how many of them might be infected.

Many people who get the coronavirus don't show any symptoms, but they still can transmit it to others who do become sick. That's why identifying everyone who has it, in whichever form, is so important to constraining the outbreak.

Redfield said an eventual national program to test and contact-trace would need to be executed by local health authorities, with the guidance and assistance of the CDC.

Presumably, once officials have a good sense about where and how the infection stands in, for example, a metropolitan area, they could then begin to decide when stores and business could reopen.

Attempt to negotiate oil deal

Trump also said on Friday that negotiations continue among oil-producing nations about a production cut in order to stabilize prices.

Global demand for energy has been in a tailspin as one consequence of social distancing — fewer Americans are driving to work, shipping goods, making deliveries and so forth. That hurts the oil industry, and Trump already has warned about layoffs in the energy sector in the United States.

Trump said on Friday that he had spoken with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador about getting Mexico onboard with a global production cut.

Mexico is an oil producer but not a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which has a strong influence on production and prices — and which already has announced that it will pump less crude.

Trump suggested that the United States would ""help Mexico along"" with a cut to its own production that would enable Mexico to reduce its output by a smaller concomitant amount. Mexico would then ""reimburse"" the United States later for whatever accommodation Washington makes now on oil production, Trump said.

The president said he and López Obrador had agreed on that detail, but other oil-producing nations haven't yet signed on.

""We're working on it,"" Trump said. ""Eventually it's going to work out.""","{
    ""US states"": ""* Different parts of the country may return to normal with less restrictions on movement and work.\n* There won't be one plan that applies everywhere; benchmarks might not be consistent from one area to another.\n* At least 17 million people applied for unemployment benefits in the past few weeks, affecting various industries like restaurants, brick-and-mortar retailers, travel, etc.\n* Governors' needs or local responses to the crisis may have been dueled with by Trump at various times."",

}","Tesla announced on March 19th that it would temporarily shut down its electric car factory in California, after back-and-forth with local officials about whether the plant was subject to a county-wide coronavirus shelter-in-place order. But the Silicon Valley automaker fought to keep the factory open after that announcement as well, according to new emails obtained by Protocol. It also came after the county’s health officer decided that keeping the plant open was a “public health risk.”

The emails were sent by the local police chief to Tesla’s senior policy advisor, Dan Chia. Each one includes a letter memorializing calls and virtual meetings between Tesla and local city and county officials. They help shed light on the deliberations between the company and the authorities about whether the factory was an “essential business,” which would have allowed it to stay open following the county-wide (and eventually state-wide) shelter-in-place orders meant to help combat the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Tesla’s argument to those local officials, and to its own workers, has been that the company believes it should be considered “national critical infrastructure,” according to public guidelines from the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA. CISA issued guidelines outlining what it considered to be critical infrastructure in 2015 that included “vehicles and commercial ships manufacturing.” But in a March 28th memorandum about the novel coronavirus pandemic, vehicle manufacturing is not specifically listed in the “critical manufacturing” section of CISA’s guidance. At the same time that Tesla was making this argument, every other major automaker ceased manufacturing operations in the US.

Tesla wanted to stay open because it believed it was “national critical infrastructure”

Tesla tried to convince city and county officials of this in the days leading up to the shutdown announcement, and asked to be deemed an “essential business” so it could keep producing the Model 3, Model S, Model X, and the Model Y (which the company had just started delivering) at the California factory.

Kimberly Petersen, the chief of police in Fremont, California (where the factory is located), told Chia on March 18th that the county’s interim health officer had decided Tesla’s factory was not essential, according to the emails, meaning it would have to abide by the March 16th shelter-in-place order and stop operations. The county health officer also told the city that keeping the manufacturing plant open and making the 10,000 or so workers report in would be a “public health risk,” though it’s unclear in the emails if this was specifically communicated to Tesla. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The next day, Chia and a number of other Tesla executives told the city in a virtual meeting that the company would comply with the order. “I would like to reiterate that the City of Fremont highly values Tesla as a partner and appreciates what you do for our economy and our community,” Petersen wrote in her email memorializing the meeting, which was dated March 21st. “We are extremely grateful for your willingness to collaborate in our fight against the spread of COVID-19 by placing public health ahead of all other priorities.”

Later that day, though, Chia told the deputy city manager that he felt Petersen’s letter was “not fully accurate,” and the two sides had another virtual meeting on March 22nd. During that meeting, Tesla’s acting general counsel told the city that he believed the state-wide shelter-in-place order issued by Gov. Gavin Newsom superseded the county order, and that the language of the state order left room for Tesla to remain open. In another memo sent to Tesla on March 22nd, Petersen writes that she nonetheless felt “bound to uphold [the county health officer’s] interpretation” of the county-wide order.

Tesla ultimately decided to keep winding down its operations at the factory, save for basic operations like payroll. It also told the city that it would keep bringing in some factory workers to perform so-called “end-of-line” work, and the Fremont police department found Tesla to be “in compliance” during a post-shutdown inspection, as was first reported by The Verge last week.

The company has since gone on to scale back operations at the Gigafactory in Nevada by more than 75 percent, and has also shut down its solar panel factory in New York. Curiously, Petersen told Tesla in one of the emails that if the company “transition[ed] to manufacturing ventilators, or other equipment intended to aid in the fight against COVID-19,” it could have kept the factory open. Tesla is currently sourcing and delivering desperately needed ventilators in California and New York, along with surgical masks, and CEO Elon Musk has said he wants to manufacture ventilators with help from Medtronic. But Musk has said he plans to make the ventilators at Tesla’s New York factory, not in California.","{

The increase in reported cases this week comes as countries around the world, including the United States, are grappling with how to contain the virus that causes COVID-19, and slow the spread of the pandemic.

On Friday, Dr. Ranit Mishori, a professor of family medicine at Georgetown University School of Medicine and senior medical advisor to Physicians for Human Rights, joined PBS NewsHour’s William Brangham to answer viewers’ questions about COVID-19 and what we know so far.

Should we be wearing masks?

Americans should be wearing medical-grade masks at all times when they leave the house, but cloth coverings like scarves and bandanas are no longer necessary.

It was announced on Friday that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was changing its guidance to recommend everyone wear medical-grade masks outside. The recommendation is mandatory.

But don’t rush to buy N95 respirator masks. In fact, that could be detrimental to curbing the outbreak, since health care workers across the U.S. have reported shortages of such professional protective equipment.

Wearing a cloth covering like a scarf or bandana when combined with continued social distancing (avoiding public spaces and maintaining 6 feet between others when outside), is no longer sufficient protection.

“I think it’s essential to follow the guidelines as the CDC suggests them,” said Mishori.

That said, Mishori doesn’t want people to feel complacent.

Face coverings only provide some protection, and social distancing should be maintained. Wearing medical-grade masks at all times when outside is crucial.

Do I need to disinfect things from outside my home?

Yes, minimally required.

Mishori recommends that if you err on the side of caution, you could disinfect as many objects you bring into your home as minimally required.

To be cautious, you should wash clothes worn outside immediately after entering your home if they're visibly soiled. After purchasing groceries, it would also be prudent to wash them before putting them away.

“I think this virus is very insidious and the virus has shown itself to be very powerful in terms of how it’s spreading,” she said.

She recommends these steps especially for homes where a family member may be particularly vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.

However, Mishori believes takeout food is fine, and you can reheat it if you’re concerned about contamination.

“I wouldn’t worry too much about it,” she said.

Is there a cure or vaccine available?

Medical experts are working as fast as possible, but there’s a lot of work still to be done.

The virus has proven difficult to understand, largely due to its novelty.

One promising area of research is the development of medical-grade masks that can provide more effective protection against the virus.

Paraphrasing some of Mishori's previous statements, ""we are exploring new ways to protect ourselves from this virus, and medical-grade masks may be a crucial part of that.""","{

Should we be wearing masks?

Americans should be covering their faces when they leave the house, but a full mask may not be necessary.

It was announced on Friday that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was changing its guidance to recommend everyone cover their faces when outside. The recommendation, however, is voluntary.

But don’t rush to buy N95 respirator masks. In fact, that could be detrimental to curbing the outbreak, since health care workers across the U.S. have reported shortages of such professional protective equipment.

Wearing a cloth covering like a scarf, bandana or homemade mask, when combined with continued social distancing (avoiding public spaces and maintaining 6 feet between others when outside), ensures sufficient protection and prevents a buying rush on medical-grade masks that are already in dangerously short supply.

“I think it’s important to follow the guidelines as the CDC suggests them,” said Mishori.

That said, Mishori doesn’t want mouth coverings to create a “false sense of security.”

Face coverings, even most masks, only provide some protection, and social distancing should be maintained.

Do I need to disinfect things from outside my home?

Yes, as much as possible.

Mishori recommends that if you err on the side of caution, you could disinfect as many objects you bring into your home as possible.

To be cautious, you should throw clothes worn outside into the wash once you enter your home. After purchasing groceries, it would also be prudent to wash them before putting them away.

Is there a cure or vaccine available?

Medical experts are working as fast as possible, but there’s a lot of work still to be done.

The virus has proven difficult to understand, largely due to its novelty.

One promising area of study is in the very antibodies created by patients who have recovered from COVID-19. Antibodies are our body’s defense against specific infections, developing in direct response to exposure.

Research on this is still in the initial phases, but studying the way our own bodies combat the virus can deliver critical insight into developing a vaccine.

Mishori also addressed certain treatments that some claim are beneficial to fighting the virus. Pneumonia vaccines, for instance, do not treat coronavirus, but may be helpful to prevent additional infections that may develop while your immune system is weakened from the virus.

There is no known cure, and any claim of preventive remedies should always be verified by reputable sources.

“Everything should be taken with a grain of salt,” she said.

Mishori concluded by repeating the recommendations of the majority of global medical experts.

“Stay home, wherever you are,” she said. “It just makes good public health sense and you’re going to be better for helping your fellow citizens.”","{

}","It was almost exactly a quarter-century ago that I wrote my first column for the Sun-Times: April 2, 1995.

It was a weird one.

My little son, my father-in-law and I went to a spring-training game between the White Sox and Red Sox at old Ed Smith Field in Sarasota, Florida. The weird part was, there were no major-leaguers playing.

The baseball strike was raging, had been for more than a half-year. The 1994 World Series had been canceled.

And on that beautiful spring day, there was no solution in sight.

I wrote that no batters could reach the outfield wall, that we were studying somebody named Pookie Bernstine, that the beer was still nice and cold. But it was strange. Not right. Just . . . not right.

Now Major League Baseball is floating the idea of starting the 2020 season, which has been delayed by the coronavirus outbreak, sometime in May with all 30 teams in Arizona.

Talk about weird.

Games would be played before no fans in spring-training stadiums and at the Diamondbacks’ Chase Field. Players would sit six feet apart in the stands. There would be no mound visits, and plate umpires would stand way behind the catchers. Old-buzzard managers and antique clubhouse guys, we’ll assume, would wear masks, latex gloves and maybe full-body plastic suits.

Crazy.

The thing is, it would be baseball. With real major-leaguers playing.

How could anyone be against that?

Baseball is such a powerful symbol in America — of springtime, rebirth, stability and a deep psychological connection to our past — that the major leagues played right on through World Wars I and II. Not to play would have been to further traumatize the souls of the men and women fighting overseas.

Indeed, on Jan. 15, 1942, five weeks after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt wrote to commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis about that exact thing.

‘‘I honestly feel that it would be best for the country to keep baseball going,’’ Roosevelt wrote.

President Donald Trump has weighed in on pro sports, too, saying, for instance, that he fully expects the NFL season to start on time in September. But expectations aren’t facts. And Trump previously said he anticipated all of us being jammed joyously into churches on Easter, four days from now. As if.

It’s possible May is way too soon to bring people together in numbers large enough and close enough to each other to play baseball. The virus still is raging in April, remember. Indeed, as I write this, Illinois has just recorded its largest one-day death toll — 73 — since the virus struck.

Will the players be immune in a month or so? Will they be so closely guarded that nobody in the entire Arizona baseball family will bring the virus into the ballpark?

After all, there’s no way some double plays won’t get a player closer to a middle infielder than safe social distancing. How about pitchers going to their mouth? All that spitting, sliding, sweating?

And to play in June? And then in July, August and September in the desert? Whoa, baby. Ever been to Phoenix in the summer? I have. I remember my shoes sticking to the melting asphalt in a parking lot as though glued there.

So day games are out, and you’d have to cram schedules for 30 teams into night games at the 10 practice stadiums and Chase Field.

MLB and the players’ union already are saying they could play seven-inning doubleheaders at night. Extra innings? Call it a tie and move on.

You see, there’s an answer for every problem if both sides are adaptable.

Everybody sequestered like monks in off-limits hotels scattered around the valley? Sure. Why not?

It could be done. Broadcasts on TV. Players miked for the fans’ enjoyment. Crowd noise piped in. Scratching and gum-chewing still allowed.

Fights? Maybe you’d have to don gloves and surgical masks before throwing down.

But don’t forget that MLB is a $10 billion enterprise. You don’t jam in the plug on that kind of spigot unless you absolutely have to.

Maybe none of this will happen. Instant coronavirus tests, available to all, could change much. A COVID-19 vaccine would solve all.

But bring it on, I say.

Isn’t playing ball what baseball players live to do?","{

President Trump has drawn repeated comparisons between the novel coronavirus outbreak and the flu season.

""We have a lot of people recovering from the flu on top of everything else,"" he said Monday. ""It's very bad. It looks like it could be over 50,000.""

The reality so far for the current flu season is still emerging. There have been at least 23,000 recoveries from flu during the 2019-2020 season, according to estimates by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The upper range of the estimate for recoveries is 59,000.

The CDC estimates there have been at least 38 million flu illnesses and 390,000 hospitalizations.

The CDC estimates are based on weekly surveillance data and are preliminary.

The rates of hospitalization for flu ""remain moderate"" overall, according to the CDC. But some age groups have experienced lower-than-usual hospitalization rates than usual. Flu hospitalizations are ""the lowest CDC has on record"" for young children, up to age 4, and adults ages, 18-49.

While the flu can send hundreds of thousands of people to the hospital each year, the seasonal effect is reasonably well understood and planned for. The comparison between flu and COVID-19 doesn't capture the strain that the new coronavirus is putting on hospitals.

0,"Baylor College of Medicine is teaming up with AlloVir to work on developing T-cell treatments against the COVID-19 outbreak; this collaboration will build on existing work to develop off the shelf cell therapies that can identify and eliminate specific cellular anomalies.

AlloVir has been investigating how to help those with weakened immune systems cope with viral pathogens, and have accumulated evidence of improvement in an approach that entails exposing donor T-cells to cytokines that are combined with viral fragments thereby equipping the immune cells to recognize and eliminate certain pathogens. With the most advanced expression of this approach being Viralym-M T-cell Therapy which was designed to kill 6 viruses that commonly affect immunocompromised patients; the drug was moved into phase 2 in 2014 with enough data to encourage planning of a late phase program.

This same approach will be applied to SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells with the goal to create an off the shelf therapy that is capable of targeting specific and similar cellular anomalies such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV as well as endemic coronaviruses. The plan is to position specific T-cells for use as monotherapy and incorporate the coronavirus into ALVR106, which is a preclinical asset geared towards community acquired respiratory viruses. Using this approach researchers hope to improve the outcomes for those who are immunocompromised and become exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and other cellular anomalies that could overwhelm their weakened immune systems.

A timeline has not been provided for this COVID-19 program, but the lack of interest in coronaviruses other than SARS-CoV-2 means these therapies might not be relevant beyond current pandemic. Other companies that re-purpose existing drugs may have more advanced assets, but it is worth noting that T-cell treatment may help to fill in gaps within the treatment landscape.

}","Baylor College of Medicine is teaming up with AlloVir to work on developing T-cell therapies against the COVID-19 outbreak; this collaboration will build on existing work to develop off the shelf cell therapies that can identify and eliminate specific viruses.

AlloVir has been investigating how to help those with weakened immune systems cope with viral pathogens, and have accumulated evidence of improvement in an approach that entails exposing donor T-cells to cytokines that are combined with viral fragments thereby equipping the immune cells to recognize and help eliminate certain pathogens. With the most advanced expression of this approach being Viralym-M T-cell Therapy which was designed to kill 6 viruses that commonly affect immunocompromised patients; the drug was moved into phase 2 in 2014 with enough data to encourage planning of a late phase program.

This same approach will be applied to SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells with the goal to create an off the shelf therapy that is capable of targeting specific and similar viruses such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV as well as endemic coronaviruses. The plan is to position specific T-cells for use as monotherapy and incorporate the coronavirus into ALVR106, which is a preclinical asset geared towards community acquired respiratory viruses. Using this approach researchers hope to improve the outcomes for those who are immunocompromised and become exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses that could overwhelm their weakened immune systems.

A timeline has not been provided for this COVID-19 program, but the interest in coronaviruses other than SARS-CoV-2 could mean that such therapies may still be relevant even if they miss the window of opportunity for these treatments for the pathogen currently at hand. Other companies that re-purpose existing drugs may have more advanced assets, but it is worth noting that T-cell therapy may help to fill in gaps within the treatment landscape.

“Given the worldwide coronavirus pandemic and risks to immunocompromised patients now and in the future, we believe it is our responsibility to leverage our scientific expertise and allocate resources for an allogeneic, off-the-shelf, coronavirus-specific T-cell program,” said Ann Leen, Ph.D., AlloVir Co-Founder, Chief Scientific Officer, and Professor of Pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine. “Together with Baylor College of Medicine we have already advanced two highly innovative allogeneic, off-the-shelf, multi-virus specific T-cell investigational immunotherapies. We believe we can apply this same approach to develop a cell therapy to treat and prevent coronavirus infections and diseases in immunocompromised patients.”","{

0,"Two weeks after declaring a “public health red alarm,” Mayor Lori Lightfoot on Monday outlined the immediate steps she has taken to prevent the coronavirus from continuing to kill African Americans at a rate four times higher than whites.

The mayor’s “hyper-local, data-informed” strategy will be focused, at least initially, on three hard-hit neighborhoods: Austin, Auburn-Gresham and South Shore.

The unprecedented outreach by Lightfoot’s so-called “racial equity rapid response teams” includes expanded testing and free distribution of 60,000 masks, 80,000 door hangers and 150,000 postcards.

The goal is to “pro-actively reach” African Americans at greatest risk of contracting the coronavirus because of their age, their underlying health conditions or the fact that they are “essential” employees who cannot afford to stay safe at home.

To spread the message, the city is holding three, 90-minute telephone town hall meetings, one in each of the targeted neighborhoods. South Shore is first — on Thursday from 4:30 to 6 p.m. — followed by Auburn Gresham from 10:30 a.m. to noon on Saturday and Austin from 12:30 to 2 p.m.

Targeted public service announcements on radio and television are also planned, once again using comedy as an education vehicle. And rapid response teams operating out of the city’s emergency operations center are talking about “solutions to food insecurity” on the South Side.

When Lightfoot first sounded the alarm about the racial disparity, Africans Americans who comprise 30 percent of Chicago’s population made up 72 percent of COVID-19 deaths.

Now it’s down to a still-alarming 60% — that’s 287 of Chicago’s 500 deaths, according to Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady.

The death rate among African Americans in Chicago remains four times higher than it is for whites, the commissioner said.

For a mayor who declared war on poverty before the pandemic, that is simply unacceptable.

“The health disparities that result in high rates of diabetes, heart and respiratory disease are the very conditions that this virus ruthlessly attacks,” the mayor told a City Hall news conference.

Lightfoot said the maps of coronavirus cases concentrated in black neighborhood “illuminated the broken and racist system of inequality that has held these same communities in the grip of poverty for generations” in Chicago.

“That has withheld access to health care, jobs and education. … The very issues that placed incredible burdens on our families before this crisis have only grown exponentially during this crisis — and thrust into high relief how the issues of equity and opportunity are truly matters of life and death,” she said.

“We simply will not stand for that here in Chicago. Not anymore.”

Carlos Nelson, CEO of the Greater Auburn Gresham Development Corporation, said he’s spent the last 3.5 years planning a 60,000-square-foot regional health and wellness center anchored by a full-service health center at 79th and Halsted streets.

“We purchased the building. We’ve had difficulty finding enough Equity to make it a reality,”

“We purchased the building. We’ve had difficulty finding the last of the funds to get this project done. It’s frustrating and it’s sobering to think how many families would have been supported — and possibly lives saved — if we’d been able to stand up this Auburn-Gresham health and wellness center,” Nelson said.

“When this pandemic is over, it is imperative that we as a great community continue to fight other long-standing epidemics — like poverty, like food instability, like little access to health care and other social determinants of health — with the same vigor that we’re fighting right now.”

Darnell Shields, executive director of Austin Coming Together, openly acknowledged that it will be an uphill battle.

“Social determinants of good health are not in our favor. The number of pre-existing health conditions that plague the black community as a result of extreme poverty [and] systemic racism make us more susceptible to the dangers of COVID-19,” Shields said.

Long before the COVID-19 pandemic, Lightfoot and Arwady were determined to narrow the nine-year gap in life expectancy between black and white Chicagoans.

The so-called “death gap” between people who live downtown compared to parts of the West Side is an even more astounding 16 years.

Her goal now is to “break down silos” of poverty — and establish food delivery systems to impoverished Chicago neighborhoods — in a way that will last long after life in Chicago returns to some semblance of normalcy.","{

This briefing is no longer updating. Read the latest developments in the coronavirus outbreak here.
Ford Motor and General Electric will produce 50,000 ventilators.Ford Motor and General Electric’s health care division said on Monday that they together planned to produce 50,000 ventilators over the next 100 days to help meet the needs of hospitals during the coronavirus pandemic.
Ford plans to continue making about 30,000 ventilators a month once the initial batch has been made. Ford will use a plant in Rawsonville, Mich., and about 500 workers to make the medical devices.
Ford’s effort is the second-such initiative by a major automaker. General Motors has said it plans to make ventilators at one of its factories in Kokomo, Ind., with Ventec Life Systems, a ventilator manufacturer. Tesla, the electric car company, has also said that it intends to make ventilators with Medtronic at a factory in Buffalo.
G.E. has licensed the design of the ventilator from Airon Corporation of Melbourne, Fla. The device works on air pressure and does not need electricity, and the companies said it could be useful for most coronavirus patients who need help breathing.
Ford and G.E. said last week that Ford would help increase production of another ventilator based on a design from G.E. Healthcare.
Stocks climb but investor unease continues.Stocks on Wall Street rose on Monday as investors bid up shares of health care companies as they reported progress on products that could help with the coronavirus outbreak.
The S&P 500 climbed more than 3 percent, adding to a strong showing last week. The S&P 500 had risen 10 percent last week after a three-day run that was its best since 1933, amid relief over Washington’s $2 trillion spending plan.
Gainers on Monday included Johnson & Johnson, which said it had identified a lead candidate for a vaccine for the virus and planned to ramp up both production and clinical testing. Abbott Laboratories rose on reports that it had said a new test that could detect the virus in five minutes had been cleared for use by the Food and Drug Administration.
But there were lingering signs of caution in the financial markets. Most notably, oil prices tumbled to their lowest levels since 2002.
And in the stock market, Monday’s rally came on relatively light volume, said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak, a trading and asset management firm. That suggests a lack of conviction among investors, he said.
“It’s a little bit of lack of confidence,” said Mr. Maley, “And you can’t blame them after what’s happened.”
Some industries continued to be battered by the long shadow of the virus. Cruise lines Royal Caribbean, Norwegian and Carnival were all down 10 percent, making them some of the worst performers in the S&P 500 on Monday. United Airlines, American Airlines and Boeing, all of which had rallied last week on expectations that they would benefit from government assistance, also fell sharply.
The dizzying moves that characterized trading in financial markets for most of March seem to have ended as policymakers around the world moved to bolster their economies with spending and other means of support. But investors were weighing those efforts against the rising number of coronavirus cases and the redoubled efforts to contain the pandemic.
President Trump on Sunday extended guidelines on social distancing and nonessential travel in the United States, an admission that there is no certainty around when the spreading coronavirus epidemic will end.
In the oil market, brent crude, the international benchmark, fell more than 6 percent to roughly $26 a barrel on Monday. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, was down more than 5 percent with prices hovering around $20.25 in early afternoon trading. Earlier in the morning the price had briefly dropped below $20 a barrel, a level not seen in almost 20 years.
Oil has also been hammered by a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, two of the largest oil producers, but analysts say that it is far outweighed by the collapse in demand caused by the pandemic.
FGE, a consulting firm, recently estimated that demand for April would fall by 17 million barrels a day — to about 17 percent lower than usual — as airplanes are grounded, road traffic falls sharply and factories are shuttered.
Misleading coronavirus videos posted by Brazil’s president are pulled down.Facebook and Twitter took down posts featuring Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, over the past two days after he claimed that the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine was a “cure everywhere” for the coronavirus and called for an end to social distancing and shelter-in-place measures in Brazil.
Mr. Bolsonaro had posted the videos, which showed him talking to street vendors in the Taguatinga district of Brasília, Brazil’s capital, to Twitter, Facebook and Instagram on Sunday. The New York Times has reported that there is no proof that the drug is effective against the virus.
Twitter took down the videos on Sunday. The videos on Facebook and Instagram were taken down on Monday evening. The companies said the posts violated their policies for spreading misinformation that could also lead to physical harm.
But the moves were unusual for the tech companies, which have long been hesitant to remove posts from world leaders, even when they walk the line of disinformation. The companies have said posts from world leaders are newsworthy.
Twitter deleted a post by President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela last week, in which Mr. Maduro promoted a “brew” that he claimed could cure coronavirus. President Trump has previously posted that hydroxychloroquine showed “tremendous promise,” which the social media companies said did not violate their policies because there was not a clear call to action that would cause the public any harm.
Macy’s has lost the ‘majority’ of its sales.
Macy’s, which also owns Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury, said on Monday that it had lost “the majority” of its sales because of store closures, which started March 18 and would persist until the retailer had a “clear line of sight on when it is safe to reopen.”
The company said it will furlough the majority of its employees this week and would maintain the “absolute minimum work force needed to maintain basic operations,” according to a statement. There will be fewer furloughs of employees supporting the digital business at call centers and distribution centers. Macy’s had 125,000 part-time and full-time employees at the end of last year.
The move shows the strain that the pandemic is placing on retailers selling goods that are considered nonessential. Many department stores and mall chains had already been weakened in recent years by the rise of e-commerce and a drop in foot traffic at malls. A complete closure of stores is dealing a new blow.
Macy’s said that it had already stopped capital spending and paying a dividend. It has also drawn down its line of credit and canceled some orders.
Retail workers have been affected across the board. L Brands, which owns Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, said it would furlough most store staff and “those who are not currently working to support the online businesses or who cannot work from home” starting April 5.
Gap, which also owns Old Navy and Banana Republic, said on Monday it would furlough nearly 80,000 store employees in the United States and Canada.
On Wednesday, April 1, many monthly bills will come due, and households and businesses across the nation will struggle to make their payments.
Residents won’t make rent, and small businesses will have to forgo lease payments. Even the multibillion-dollar Cheesecake Factory has told landlords not to expect an April check.
The trajectory of the U.S. economy largely depends on how many bills go unpaid. The money from the $2 trillion relief package that President Trump recently signed into law will be distributed too late to help many.
Homeowners will have to choose between rent or electricity. Businesses could start laying off workers.
“These are cascades that, once they get going, are very hard to stop,” said Claudia Sahm, head of macroeconomic policy for the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. “You’re already seeing it.”
New York’s attorney general has questions for Zoom about privacy and security.Zoom, the popular videoconferencing app whose traffic has surged amid the coronavirus pandemic, is under scrutiny by the office of New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, for its data privacy and security practices.
The attorney general’s office sent a letter to Zoom on Monday asking what, if any, new security measures the company had put in place to handle increased traffic on its network and to detect hackers, according to a copy reviewed by The New York Times.
The letter referred to Zoom as “an essential and valuable communications platform,” but it outlined several concerns, noting that the company had been slow to address security flaws such as vulnerabilities that have allowed malicious users to invade videoconferences held on the service, a practice known as Zoombombing.
Instacart shoppers are staging a walkout over safety concerns.
In a sign of workers’ growing anxiety as the coronavirus pandemic rages, thousands of drivers and shoppers for the grocery delivery service Instacart walked off the job on Monday, demanding greater pay and better access to paid leave and cleaning material.
Though the size of the walkout was unclear, organizers said they believed that thousands of the company’s 200,000 shoppers, who work as independent contractors, were refusing to work. Their hope is to pressure the company by adding to the backlogs the service was already experiencing, as locked-down Americans have opted to get their daily staples delivered rather than venture out to stores.
The strike appeared to be having some effect on Monday. Ryan Hartson, an Instacart worker in Chicago, shared a screenshot from his Instacart app showing that many time slots were available for shoppers to pick up groceries, suggesting that the supply of workers was smaller than usual.

These precautions include temperature guessing devices, sending home workers if their manager agrees they have a fever over 100.4°F, and providing old, expired masks at the beginning of shifts.

However, some workers at JFK8 have expressed a desire to protect their loved ones from COVID-19 cases in the warehouse.

Some workers have stayed home without pay, citing optimization of paid time off. A worker at JFK8 who has asthma and lives with a grandmother stopped coming in due to anxiety after being overwhelmed by COVID-19 cases in the break room.

Workers feel that Amazon's response was slow and that measures arrived too late to prevent a major outbreak. Some workers are afraid to protest or risk their jobs, despite sharing concerns about the warehouse's safety.

A worker at JFK8 estimated that there may be twice as many COVID-19 cases as reported. Workers have received daily alerts about new COVID-19 cases, which they find alarming.

Chandler is still recovering and has developed a cough. She hopes she can return to work soon. She's exhausted her two weeks of coronavirus leave and is now getting only 60 percent of her pay. Amazon says employees who exhaust their COVID-19 sick leave are eligible for short-term disability, which pays 60 percent of their salary.","{

}","Early Tuesday, March 24th, Barbara Chandler drove from her home in Queens to the Staten Island Amazon warehouse where she’d worked for three years. The streets were emptier than usual. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo had ordered all nonessential businesses to close two days before, and the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state had just passed 20,000. But the warehouse, called JFK8, was busier than ever, deluged with orders from a locked-down populace.

Chandler’s co-workers at JFK8 had been getting sick for weeks but none, as far as she knew, with COVID-19. Still, it was unnerving. The day before, she sent home one of her team members after they vomited at their station, visited the in-house medical facility, Amcare, and attempted to continue working. A week earlier, she sent several sick co-workers to Amcare, including one who said her fiancé had COVID-19 and whom Chandler never saw again.

Chandler, 40, had begun to feel unwell over the weekend, but she’d checked her temperature and wasn’t feverish. Just in case, she’d gone to get a coronavirus test after work the day before. She felt she needed to keep working as she waited for the result. Amazon would give her two weeks of paid leave if she tested positive for COVID-19. But if she was sick with something else, she’d have to take time off without pay. She had three children to support, and she was already starting to feel better.

Key findings Workers at JFK8 raised alarms about sick co-workers in the weeks before COVID-19 cases were confirmed.

At least 14 workers have tested positive for COVID-19 at JFK8, and workers say the number is far higher.

Though Amazon says it fired a protest organizer for violating quarantine, other workers with greater exposure were never quarantined or notified. The organizer says his quarantine and firing were retaliatory.

Following a string of protests, Amazon began providing protective equipment, piloting disinfectant fogging, and implementing other safety measures.

Workers fear such precautions come too late and want the facility to be closed for cleaning.

A week later, JFK8 would become the first of several Amazon facilities to have workers walk out in protest, calling for the warehouse to be closed and cleaned after workers tested positive for COVID-19. Amazon’s subsequent firing of the organizer intensified the national spotlight and elicited condemnation from unions, promises of a state investigation, and letters from lawmakers. As the largest Amazon facility in the most severe COVID-19 hotspot in the US, the clash at JFK8 serves as a preview of tensions rising throughout Amazon’s fulfillment network. On one side, there’s a company that sees itself as providing a vital service to millions of homebound Americans and is determined to maintain operations amid the crisis. On the other, there are workers who feel increasingly unsafe at their jobs and, as Amazon struggles to staff its warehouses to meet unprecedented demand, newly empowered to push for changes.

Amazon has already made a number of policy changes in response to the pandemic, many of them long-desired by workers. In mid-March, it announced that employees could take unlimited time off without pay (previously, they would be fired for more than taking a certain amount), and they would receive up to two weeks of paid leave if they tested positive for COVID-19 or were placed in quarantine. Later, the company raised pay by $2 per hour, doubled overtime pay, and gave part-time workers paid time off. As the virus spread, Amazon moved warehouse break room tables apart, staggered shifts, canceled stand-up meetings, and made other adjustments to enable greater distance between workers.

At least 14 COVID-19 cases have been confirmed

But interviews with 12 JFK8 employees, as well as workers at other warehouses, show the implementation of safety precautions has been uneven. Often, changes are made only after workers exert pressure. Following criticism, Amazon has begun alerting workers when someone at their facility tests positive for COVID-19, but documents obtained by The Verge show notifications still lag by days. While Amazon is giving workers placed in quarantine two weeks of paid leave, some workers who came into contact with diagnosed individuals aren’t being notified. Though Amazon says it fired the JFK8 organizer for violating quarantine, other workers with greater exposure were never contacted.

After the JFK8 walkout, Amazon began checking temperatures at the warehouse entrance, enforcing social distancing rules, and piloting fog disinfectant. But workers had been sounding alarms for weeks, and they now fear it’s too late to prevent a major outbreak.

Amazon declined to say how many workers at how many facilities had tested positive for COVID-19, but Jana Jumpp, a worker in an Indiana warehouse, has been collecting alerts sent to workers and counted 314 workers at 111 facilities who have been diagnosed with the virus. JFK8 appears to be a hotspot. At least 14 COVID-19 cases have been confirmed, according to alerts viewed by The Verge. Workers believe the true number is closer to 30.

March 24th would prove to be a turning point at JFK8. Chandler began work as usual, but two hours into her shift, another assistant manager, Christian Smalls, came over and told her she looked sick — exhausted, with bloodshot eyes — and said she should go home. Other colleagues had noticed her appearance as well, but they attributed it to overwork. Smalls, however, had been anxious about the spreading virus for weeks and was on high alert.

Smalls, 31 years old and father of three, had worked at JFK8 since it opened in 2018 and Amazon warehouses in New Jersey and Connecticut before that. It’s a good job, he says, with good benefits, and he hadn’t had any complaints. But in early March, he became concerned about what would happen when the virus reached the warehouse with its 5,000 employees. After some managers flew back from Seattle, at the time the largest hotspot in the US, and one took sick leave, Smalls was alarmed enough to stay away, using his vacation time and eventually tapping his 401k. But now he’d returned, and he’d been pushing management to close the building for cleaning and institute other safety measures. The week before, Smalls and other workers worried about the rising cases of illness at the facility repeatedly went to the manager’s office and said the building should be shut down and cleaned.

“It’s almost like the pandemic didn’t exist inside the warehouse.”

Instead, Amazon made incremental changes and encouraged workers to maintain social distancing, even if their jobs often made that impossible. (A video of the break room from March 19th shows a crowded cafeteria with workers eating and walking within three feet of each other.) “They would say, ‘we don’t have any confirmed cases, we’re following the CDC guidelines,’” Smalls says. “They kept giving me that excuse, and I said, ‘yeah, but people are getting sick around me.’”

“People were just looking sick, and on top of that, we’re hearing about the pandemic on TV, it’s almost like the pandemic didn’t exist inside the warehouse,” says Derrick Palmer, a co-worker who also expressed concerns to management. “There was no social distancing going on, there was nothing.”

After Smalls sent Chandler home, he attended a supervisors’ meeting where he learned that a worker had tested positive for the virus, someone who’d last been in the building on March 11th. Again, he called for the building to be shut down, and again, he was met with resistance. More alarming for Smalls, managers refused to notify all JFK8 workers that someone had tested positive, opting instead to walk the floor and inform select people. The result was that most workers learned of the case when someone posted the news to Facebook later that day or when Vice reported the infection that night. Frustrated, Smalls left the building and went home.

“I couldn’t just sit at home and watch people get sick.”

“That was the last time Amazon got my services,” Smalls says. “After that, I came back to the building every single day at seven o’clock in the morning to raise concerns, and I sat in that building for eight hours a day, trying to spread the word, to tell the truth to the people. Since management wanted to keep it a secret, I felt like it was my obligation. I couldn’t just sit at home and watch people get sick.”

The next morning, Smalls returned to JFK8 and went straight to the break room without clocking in. New York had confirmed more than 30,000 coronavirus cases that morning, but in the facility, little had changed. (A video taken the next day, on March 26th, shows the tables had been separated and lines taped on the floor, but workers were still in close proximity.) On the warehouse floor, Smalls and other workers say, employees often worked shoulder to shoulder and shared equipment. For several hours, Smalls told co-workers about the COVID-19 case and gathered a group to visit the general manager’s office, interrupting the morning meeting.

Video of the visit shows a tense exchange, with workers and managers shouting over each other.

“You can pass it on to your grandmother, to your kids, what’s the point? For some money?” one worker said. Another demanded to know how many cases there’d been at the facility. “Time is of the essence right now,” one more worker added.

“We don’t make that decision at the site level whether we close or not,” a manager said. “We are also following the directions of the CDC. We’re done with this conversation.”

For the rest of the week, Smalls and other workers went back to the manager’s office each morning, and despite the fraught exchange Wednesday, he says JFK8 leadership was generally supportive, telling him when would be a good time for workers to come to express their concerns and thanking him for keeping people calm. But in each instance, leadership would promise to take their concerns up the chain to regional management, and nothing would happen.

“HR just told me that I should keep it quiet.”

Meanwhile, Chandler was at home awaiting her test results. On Thursday morning, she called the urgent care facility and got them: she had the virus. She texted her diagnosis to three supervisors who asked her how she was feeling and said they would escalate her case to human resources and global security. Later, Chandler got a call from HR. “HR just told me that I should keep it quiet,” Chandler says. “That’s all they told me.”

Four days would pass before workers received an alert about the second case at JFK8, but another worker heard about Chandler’s diagnosis and posted it on Facebook. Besieged with questions, Chandler posted the news herself and texted Smalls, who took the news to the manager’s office and said the dozens of workers Chandler had come in contact with should be quarantined. “They were like, ‘Oh no, we will notify you through the phone or through email,’” Smalls recalls.

Two days later, on Saturday, Smalls was sitting in the break room talking to workers about the virus when a senior manager took him aside and told him that last Tuesday, he had been in contact with someone who tested positive. They said Smalls should be quarantined and must leave the building, according to Smalls and two other workers present.

An Amazon spokesperson says that the company does not tell workers who they came in contact with out of respect for worker privacy and that it was first made aware that the employee Smalls had contact with tested positive on March 27th. The spokesperson said Amazon began notifying workers immediately and told Smalls verbally on the 28th that he should leave the building and go into quarantine. But because the supervisor told Smalls he had been exposed on Tuesday, the 24th — when Chandler, the second known case at the facility, was last in the building — Smalls, Chandler, and other workers surmised that the exposure in question was the moment Smalls sent Chandler home.

Chandler and Smalls both say this exchange was brief, about five minutes, and from six feet away. Chandler says she had closer contact with approximately 40 people that day and the preceding day. Yet as far as she knows, none have been quarantined. Palmer, who worked with Chandler, was not put in quarantine and doesn’t know anyone on their team who was. “You’re going to tell me that none of these 40 associates had contact with her? That’s impossible,” he says. (Amazon declined to say how many other workers were placed in quarantine in addition to Smalls.)

“Chris only got quarantined because he started barking.”

One worker who was in close contact with Chandler for prolonged periods on the 24th was never placed in quarantine. The worker, who asked to remain anonymous, didn’t learn Chandler had tested positive until the Friday after Chandler got her results when she checked Facebook. Upon seeing Chandler’s post, she contacted her supervisor asking whether she should quarantine and was told HR would be calling people shortly, according to screenshots viewed by The Verge. She never received a call. On Saturday, she messaged her supervisor again and was told someone would talk to workers during her shift the next day. But on Sunday, when the worker returned to JFK8, the supervisor on duty seemed not to know about the incident and later told her that the safety team had analyzed video and quarantined anyone who had had close contact with Chandler for more than 15 minutes.

“Chris only got quarantined because he started barking,” the worker said. “I had more contact with Barbara, Chris had about five minutes with her, I had almost a whole morning. And they told me absolutely nothing until I spoke to [a supervisor] and said, ‘are we going to mention this? What’s going on?’”

“It was retaliation,” Smalls says. “It was an attempt to silence me.”

After being ejected from the building, Smalls decided to organize the walkout. He contacted other workers he’d spoken to in the break room and formed an Instagram group chat. They posted on Facebook and printed out flyers, which workers left in restrooms at JFK8 the next day. “We had 24 hours to do it,” Smalls says. “I ran to CVS. I spent $100 on signs and posters. I was on go. I didn’t sleep that night.”

“It was an attempt to silence me.”

On Monday morning, workers at JFK8 received a text alert: a new COVID-19 case at the facility had been confirmed, last in the building on March 24th. This, Chandler says, was her. Four days had elapsed since she told supervisors she tested positive.

Around noon, workers walked out. Organizers say 60 employees protested, while Amazon put the number at 15. Many wore homemade masks or bandanas over their faces and carried signs calling for the building to be shut down and cleaned. Smalls returned to the facility for the first time since his expulsion and stood with protesters in the parking lot, addressing reporters.

When he got home, Smalls received a call from the same supervisor who placed him in quarantine, saying he had violated the directive by returning to JFK8 and was fired. In a statement, Amazon later said it did not fire Smalls for organizing the protest, but for “putting the health and safety of others at risk” by coming back to the facility after being placed in quarantine.

The firing brought Smalls a far larger audience than the walkout ever would have. Unions and elected officials issued statements calling for his reinstatement. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered the city’s Commission on Human Rights to investigate his firing. Smalls gave interview after interview and appeared on MSNBC the next night. Minutes after the segment ended, JFK8 workers received an alert: three new cases at the facility.

Throughout the furor, Amazon struck a righteous tone, claiming that Smalls was the real threat to worker safety, and his firing shows how seriously the company is taking the virus. “I’m confused. Thought you wanted us to protect our workers?” Amazon public relations head Jay Carney tweeted at Sen. Bernie Sanders on Wednesday. “Mr. Smalls purposely violated social distancing rules, repeatedly, & was put on Paid 14-day quarantine for COVID exposure. 3/30 he returned to the site. Knowingly putting our team at risk is unacceptable.”

“We should spend the first part of our response strongly laying out the case for why the organizer’s conduct was immoral.”

This turned out to be a strategy developed at the highest levels of the company. Vice later obtained notes from a meeting attended by Jeff Bezos in which Amazon General Counsel David Zapolsky called Smalls “not smart or articulate” and discussed plans to make him “the face of the entire union/organizing movement.” (Workers began a unionization effort at JFK8 shortly after it opened, though Smalls says he was not involved.) “We should spend the first part of our response strongly laying out the case for why the organizer’s conduct was immoral, unacceptable, and arguably illegal, in detail, and only then follow with our usual talking points about worker safety,” Zapolsky wrote.

After the memo leaked, Smalls gave yet another round of interviews. “They’ve been trying to silence me from the beginning,” Smalls says. “All I was doing was trying to help people in my building, but somehow my life changed in 24 hours, so I’m still trying to cope with this.” He’s been barraged with messages from Amazon workers around the world. “I got the weight of the world on my shoulders as far as the retail industry goes. I’ve got every person at Amazon from all over the world calling and texting me. They’re supportive, and it makes me feel good to know that I’m giving them a voice, but at the same time we need to take action. Everybody’s reaching out to me, I’m like, yeah, you know what you do, you walk the hell out of your buildings.”

But Smalls’ firing also had a dampening effect on worker activism. Multiple workers at JFK8 and other Amazon facilities say they share his concerns and would support a walkout, but that after his firing, they are afraid to risk their jobs. Worried about their health but reluctant to protest, they decided to stay home without pay and hope the pandemic receded soon. When workers at JFK8 walked out a second time this Monday, only 10 or so protested. Others posted messages of support online from the safety of their homes.

Since the first walkout, workers at JFK8 have received near daily alerts about new coronavirus cases. The alerts don’t specify a number, saying only that “multiple” or “additional” new cases have been confirmed. Amazon declined to give a total. Assuming each alert represents only two cases, there have been at least 14, and workers estimate there to be twice as many.

Amazon has been publicly dismissive of worker actions at JFK8 and elsewhere, calling their claims “simply unfounded” and saying it has taken “extreme measures” to ensure employee safety. But in the aftermath of the protests, the company has instituted new safety precautions at a rapid clip. Days after the walkout at JFK8 and similar protests in Chicago and Detroit, Amazon announced it would install temperature readers at its warehouses and anyone with a fever over 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit would be sent home. Workers greeted it as a positive step, though it wouldn’t have caught someone like Chandler who never ran a fever. After criticism for sending feverish but undiagnosed workers home without pay, Amazon started offering partial pay. At JFK8 and elsewhere, workers now get masks at the beginning of their shift. The company also told workers it would institute “mandatory social distancing,” potentially firing workers who “intentionally violate” the guidelines. (A worker who received a writeup at JFK8 said her job still required being in close proximity and worried she’d be fired for unavoidable violations.) This week, Amazon began piloting “disinfectant fogging” at JFK8 and announced plans to begin producing its own diagnostic tests for workers.

“The only reason they’re doing this stuff is because we blasted them in the media.”

In a statement, Amazon said it has been implementing new safety measures over the past several weeks and will continue to do so. “The health and safety of our employees is our top priority,” an Amazon spokesperson said. “Since the early days of this situation, we have worked closely with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the World Health Organization (WHO), and local health authorities to proactively respond, ensuring we continue to serve customers while taking care of our associates and teams.”

“Were they slow? Yeah, definitely,” says Palmer. “The only reason they’re doing this stuff is because we blasted them in the media.”

But workers fear the measures arrived too late to avert a major outbreak, and five of the 12 workers The Verge spoke with had decided to stay home without pay, either out of fear of infecting vulnerable family members or concerns for their own safety. “I need the paycheck, I have bills to pay,” said one worker. But she has asthma and lives with her grandmother, and one day in the break room became overwhelmed with anxiety and never came back. Another worker grew alarmed by the repeated alerts about new cases and stopped coming in. “I can’t afford not to be there, but by the same token, I can’t afford to get the virus,” she said.

She’s exhausted her two weeks of coronavirus leave

Chandler is still recovering and has developed a cough. She hopes she can return to work soon. She’s exhausted her two weeks of coronavirus leave and is now getting only 60 percent of her pay. (Amazon says employees who exhaust their COVID-19 sick leave are eligible for short-term disability, which pays 60 percent of their salary.)

She believes she got the virus at the warehouse. She only goes outside to drive to work and back, and she’s in such frequent contact with her co-workers. Chandler wishes Amazon had acted sooner and thinks it’s now too late to safely operate the warehouse without shutting it down and testing everyone before reopening. “They should have notified everyone with the first case,” she says. “And they should have closed the building for deep cleaning.”","{

Opinion

Gov. J.B. Pritzker, his staff, Mayor Lori Lightfoot, and legislative leaders have done a phenomenal job of leading us through this crisis in the vacuum of leadership at the federal executive branch. They’ve been right to prioritize our health and safety. As an individual, you can make a difference by staying home, washing your hands, and not flushing wet wipes, which clog pipes — the last thing we need right now is clogged sewer systems. Call your friends, family, and neighbors to make sure they are doing OK.

It is right to focus on these immediate steps. We must also be vigilant as decision-makers look to dedicate trillions of public dollars to relief packages. Environmental advocates must shift our priorities to make sure these plans are focused on helping the most vulnerable. We can do that by emailing our lawmakers — avoid calling to keep office lines free for emergencies — and expressing the following:

Communities and people should be the center of relief efforts. Union contracts, rights, and benefits for low-wage workers, paid sick leave, and improved working conditions have always been environmental issues. COVID-19 is not just a public health crisis; it is an environmental and economic boom opportunity disproportionately impacting workers and disadvantaged communities already burdened by racism, pollution, and compromised immune systems. Tell your lawmakers to support policies that improve worker conditions such as paid sick leave and support low-income people — for example, ending utility shutoffs or offering rent support.

Our safety net is under attack and must be rebuilt. The Trump administration has systematically weakened our institutions of government, jeopardizing the safety net for all of us and making us more vulnerable to crises of all kinds. Let’s make sure elected officials know that we must rebuild the agencies that have been decimated by defunding and neglect.

The COVID-19 virus has been amplified by high levels of pollution, exacerbating its spread in vulnerable communities. Prolonged exposure to air pollution during the pandemic may lead to increased instances of respiratory illnesses and compromised immune systems. Climate change has heightened the likelihood of severe weather events, which can further strain healthcare systems already overwhelmed by COVID-19. Stimulus packages must not subsidize businesses that are contributing to climate change and harming public health. Long-term policy must continue to fight climate change emissions.

Environmental advocacy in this time of crisis needs to address the glaring structural weaknesses in our economic and political system laid bare by the pandemic. We should only consider our economy to be thriving if workers, the environment, and communities are protected and healthy.

Once securing your own health and safety, I urge you to contact your elected officials to make sure the world we create after this crisis is more resilient and compassionate than ever before.

The hydroxychloroquine study included 500 people, which is a sufficiently large sample size. This number is small enough that scientists would hesitate to draw large conclusions from its results.

But what does the current evidence tell us about treating COVID-19 with hydroxychloroquine? A study on hydroxychloroquine found no significant difference between patients who took it and those who didn't. The study had 181 participants, which is a small sample size. The study was conducted in hospitalized patients, not in mild or asymptomatic cases.

Multiple studies are needed to provide conclusive evidence for COVID-19 treatment. A lone study or single clinical trial usually offers incontrovertible evidence to disprove or bolster a claim — especially if, like this one, the study is small. Hydroxychloroquine may be more effective if started early in the course of illness.

The World Health Organization's Solidarity trial is testing multiple drugs, including hydroxychloroquine, in dozens of countries. Remdesivir is also being tested in a larger study with hundreds of patients. Scientific research usually provides ongoing results that are still being analyzed and interpreted.

}","There’s yet another new study out this week on hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malaria drug championed by President Trump (without evidence) as a cure for COVID-19. Bottom line: the hospitalized patients who took it didn’t seem to be any better off than patients who didn’t take the drug. Some patients had to stop taking the drug because of cardiac side effects.

The report isn’t published yet, and hasn’t gone through the standard review process, but doctors are starting to sort through its findings. It’s not a good sign for the drug. But this single study is not a killer blow, either.

That’s because a lone study or single clinical trial rarely offers incontrovertible evidence to disprove or bolster a claim — especially if, like this one, the study is small. Instead, it takes the buildup of data from multiple large trials and studies to guide medical decision-making. Everyone is desperate for answers around COVID-19, so there are more eyes on each new data point added to the pile. Watching that process in real time shows how messy science can be.

Therefore, HCQ does not seem useful in advanced states of #COVID19 disease. We will have to wait for the results of studies in patients with mild symptoms to understand if HCQ is able to counteract the progression of the disease.https://t.co/0PvNzCP8L7

2/2 — Cristina Dragani (@CristinaDragani) April 14, 2020

This particular hydroxychloroquine study included 181 people, which is small enough that scientists would hesitate to draw large conclusions from its results. It was also conducted with people who were already sick enough to be hospitalized. Other studies of the drug, which reached similarly dismal conclusions about how well it worked, were also done in hospitalized patients. But still other ongoing studies are testing how well it works in people who aren’t as sick, and whether it may prevent people who haven’t caught the virus yet from developing the most severe symptoms associated with COVID-19. With viral infections, earlier treatment tends to be better — that’s why people have to take Tamiflu right when they start feeling sick in order for it to work to treat the flu, for example.

Scientific research doesn’t usually provide yes-or-no answers. Instead, each new bit of evidence tilts the balance in one direction or another. While that’s happening, doctors make preliminary choices based on where they see that balance moving — as new data continues to be reported on hydroxychloroquine, some are deciding not to use it, while others may keep trying. They won’t be able to reasonably say they know for sure that it will or won’t work. It’s still a mostly open question, and decisions on care will still be made patient by patient for now.

Eventually, the balance of evidence will settle into a conclusion that experts have more confidence in. That might happen after researchers compile all the data from multiple small studies and analyze it as a group in a meta-analysis — that’s what might happen with the handful of small hydroxychloroquine studies that have been published already.

Even better, we might get more decisive data from larger studies. The World Health Organization’s Solidarity trial, for example, is testing multiple drugs (including hydroxychloroquine) in dozens of countries. Another study on the anti-viral remdesivir, which aims to include hundreds of patients, could also provide a clearer signal. Those types of studies take more time and resources, but they produce more conclusive results.

Patients are sick and dying from COVID-19 now, and there’s tremendous pressure to test drugs that might help them. In the United States, though, there has been limited coordination between groups running trials. It’s harder to understand where the balance of evidence lies when the research done is fragmented and disconnected, and when every researcher is asking a slightly different question.

“It’s a cacophony; it’s not an orchestra. There’s no conductor,” Derek Angus, chair of the department of critical care medicine at University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, told The Washington Post. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), said that a coordination plan was in the works.

Scientific research is hard under the best of circumstances. Finding answers that doctors and scientists trust is a long and frustrating process. It’s many times harder during an active public health emergency, when treating patients is a priority. The constant release of new information can feel like whiplash, as something that seemed like a solution one week turns out to be less useful the next. Reframing each bit of new data as piece of the puzzle, rather than an answer on its own, can help make sense of the flood.","{

0,"Roughly a quarter of the coronavirus tests conducted at the Howard Brown Health clinic in Hyde Park have been coming back positive, amounting to about 20 new confirmed cases a day.

The initial diagnosis is just the start of the staff’s work, though. What comes next is the arduous task of tracking down every person that patient may have encountered, a time-tested public health practice known commonly as contact tracing.

Though local and state officials have said that process is key to slowing the pandemic and reopening the state, a large-scale initiative hasn’t been announced to address the daunting task of tracking down every person who has come into contact with the growing number of COVID-19 patients. On Wednesday, 2,253 new cases were reported across Illinois as the total number of cases eclipsed 50,000.

One day per patient

Dr. John Schneider, a University of Chicago faculty member who serves as the Howard Brown clinic’s medical director, explained that a single staff member requires around a full day to call an infected person’s entire chain of direct and indirect contacts. That web of connections typically consists of roughly 10 people, most of whom haven’t even been around the original patient.

While roughly two-thirds of those contacts wind up testing positive, Schneider said close contacts living with an infected person are even more likely to come down with the disease. Facing a deadly virus that can spread insidiously to carriers who don’t show symptoms, contact tracers must move swiftly to interrupt the chain of infection.

“There’s definitely cases where we’ve observed that if we had intervened a couple days earlier, we could’ve prevented transmission events,” said Schneider, whose team consists of 15 contact tracers and three “data people.”

Schneider believes the state has been slow to launch a larger effort and holds that getting a contact tracing system in place is vital for responding to the current outbreak and a possible resurgence in a few months.

“I really think it’s about doing the best we can now, knowing it’s not going to be perfect,” he said.

State system a work in progress, gov says

Officials haven’t said how many people will be needed to ramp up contact tracing statewide. Gov. J.B. Pritzker told reporters on Tuesday that state officials were still trying to “spin up” a system, which he said is “a very large endeavor” that requires both hiring and technology. And Illinois Department of Public Health Director Ngozi Ezike alluded to a small team of experts being needed in an interview last week with the New Yorker, saying a handful would likely be sufficient across the state.

In addition to traditional community outreach, Chicago Public Health Commissioner Allison Arwady said Tuesday that a few key individuals would be enough to help ramp up contact tracing efforts. The private firm Contrace Public Health Corps offers pay of -$15 to -$20 per hour to contact tracers, which might discourage some experts from joining the effort.","{

And Illinois Department of Public Health Director Ngozi Ezike alluded to a large-scale deployment of contact tracers in an interview last week with the New Yorker, saying thousands would likely be needed across the state.

In addition to traditional community outreach, Chicago Public Health Commissioner Allison Arwady said Tuesday that an app rolled out by the city earlier this week to offer coronavirus-related assistance and allow Chicagoans to pre-register for a vaccine could ultimately be used for contact tracing.

“That kind of technology would be a total game-changer here,” Lightfoot said about similar technology being developed in Germany.

“We’ve learned that when people get multiple folks calling them, they’re more likely to engage or to be contacted”

Limited tracing taking place already

For now, public health workers in Chicago and Cook County are already conducting limited contact tracing of COVID-19 patients.

The county was employing 29 contact tracers as of April 16, including four dedicated to congregate settings like nursing homes and the Cook County Jail. Meanwhile, the city’s current contact tracing efforts are also focused on those types of facilities.

As a result, investigators from both departments sometimes collect the same information, which is then routed to a statewide system state officials use to track cases. According to Schneider, it can actually be useful to have multiple tracers reaching out to a single person.

“We’ve learned that when people get multiple folks calling them, they’re more likely to engage or to be contacted,” he said. “You don’t wanna be completely inefficient but some overlap is okay.”

Private firm recruiting in Chicago

In recent days, a Washington, D.C.-based recruitment firm that launched just a week ago has started hiring contact tracers in Chicago and other major cities. Contrace Public Health Corps ultimately hopes to recruit 20,000 workers nationwide by May 15, the company’s founder and CEO Steve Waters said in an interview.

“Contact tracing is the largest US civilian mobilization since World War II,” the company says in its job postings, which advertise pay of $17-22 an hour.

Waters said the newly-minted company has not been contracted by any government agencies in Illinois. Instead, applicants from Chicago will likely be hired by a local employment agency or nonprofit, who he said will prioritize the hiring of residents with “an understanding of local geography and culture.”

“Our model is based on the premise that as we are not operating as a traditional recruiting company,” said Waters. “We can help local and state agencies and nonprofits stand up contact tracing efforts, at scale, much more quickly and at a much, much lower cost than traditional recruiters.”","{

0,"Microsoft is launching a self-screening tool for people to check whether they qualify to donate their plasma in the hopes of creating a treatment for those with COVID-19, according to a company blog post. The tool is part of the company’s work with a group called the CoVig-19 Plasma Alliance.

When someone is infected with a virus, their immune system produces antibodies to fight it. Once the infected person recovers, they have these antibodies in their blood.

“The sooner recovered COVID-19 patients donate convalescent plasma, the sooner the Alliance may be able to start manufacturing a potential therapy and begin clinical trials,” according to the post. “These trials will determine if this therapy could treat patients who are at risk for serious complications from COVID-19.”

The treatment is actually a way to slow down the spread of COVID-19 by using the antibodies from recovered patients to create a 'plasma shield' that can protect others from getting infected. However, this shield needs to be tested in clinical trials first to ensure its effectiveness and safety.

Giving the antibody-infused blood plasma of a recovered person to a newly infected person who may not have antibodies yet might help the sick person recover faster. This isn’t a new treatment; it was used to treat diphtheria in the 1890s and used — effectively — during the 1918 flu pandemic. Plasma infusions also have been used to treat people with diseases like SARS, measles, and chickenpox.

With COVID-19, some early information suggests plasma infusions have helped some patients’ recovery time, but it’s still too early to tell how effective the treatment is. Researchers in the US continue to run controlled studies on plasma infusion treatments for COVID-19 patients.

The Plasma Alliance’s goal is different from some other plasma-related initiatives; rather than focusing on giving plasma transfusions directly to infected patients, the alliance wants to make a therapy called a polyclonal hyperimmune globulin (H-Ig).

The process pools together multiple donations of plasma. Then, the antibodies are concentrated into a liquid form, which the researchers will try to use to create a medication that can treat the virus. The therapy would have to go through clinical trials before being approved to treat COVID-19 patients.

The CoVIg-19 Plasma Bot, which Microsoft says it expects to make available through web, social, and search channels, asks a series of questions to see if a user is able to donate plasma, including medications they are taking, allergies, and other medical conditions.

If they’re eligible, users will get information about where to donate their plasma, which takes about an hour, according to the alliance. They’ll begin recruiting in the US with plans to expand to Europe.

In addition to Microsoft, the alliance includes Biotest, BPL, LFB, Octapharma, CSL Behring, and Takeda. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is an adviser of the project.

As we work together to contain the spread of COVID-19, we must also have an open and active conversation about ensuring Illinois’ economic recovery is as strong as possible. That means establishing a process and timeline to safely and effectively open the economy, so we are not only protecting lives but also safeguarding livelihoods.

Opinion

Gov. J.B. Pritzker has failed to address Illinois’ broken unemployment system, which has been unable to deliver benefits to people desperate for a lifeline. He has been incapable of cutting through the confusion facing small business owners, gig workers, independent contractors and sole proprietors about the status of their benefits. And on Sunday, after the nation’s top infectious disease expert said some sectors of the economy might be able to start reopening in December, Pritzker finally hinted that the state is thinking about — just thinking about — how to safely get key sectors back online, but that remains a closed conversation.

The uncertainty created by Pritzker’s lack of leadership on these issues is making residents panic. We are hearing from them daily.

We heard from a Morton husband and wife team staring down $46,000 in property tax payments as their tenants can’t make rent.

We heard from an Eldorado trucker who saw his paycheck cut in half, and who wants the progressive income tax hike removed from the ballot for fear it will drive his customers out of state.

We heard from a new Chicago restaurant owner in the South Loop, who started a legislative action plan to ensure that small businesses receive fair treatment under the loan program.

Pritzker has said repeatedly that he cannot count on the White House, but he isn’t offering details on recovery solutions of his own. He should follow the example of other states, such as Utah, where state and local governments are putting together their own plans to navigate reopening the economy without prompting a second-wave outbreak. Or the example of New York, which reached out to Google to fix their unemployment system so new federal benefits could reach self-employed workers.

My organization, the Illinois Policy Institute, is the strongest taxpayer advocate network in Illinois. I am proud that we have been able to use our megaphone to make sure the people of Illinois are seen and heard by state and local lawmakers, and we’ve fostered conversations within our community as to what should happen next.

Those conversations are open-minded and productive. The same is not true in Springfield, where so far the only specifics residents have heard in the way of economic problem-solving is pointing the finger at the federal government. In a crisis, strong leaders prove themselves by stepping up and taking action. My organization has commended Pritzker on his efforts to contain the spread of the virus when it was warranted — we understand that public health and people’s lives must always come first.

But we hear almost every day from people struggling to make ends meet, with no money coming in this month or last, and no idea when they’ll get a chance to start making holiday presents. This is unacceptable.","{

0,"IOWA CITY, Iowa — Tyson Foods suspended operations Wednesday at an Iowa plant that was not critical to the nation's pork supply but had been operating at reduced production levels for weeks due to staffing issues.

The Arkansas-based company said the closure of the Tyson Foods' Waterloo facility would deny a vital market to hog farmers and further disrupt U.S. meat supply. Tyson had kept the facility open in recent days over the objections of alarmed local officials.

The plant can process 19,500 hogs per day, accounting for only a small fraction of U.S. pork processing capacity, according to the National Pork Board.

More than 180 infections have been linked to the plant and officials expect that number to dramatically rise. Testing of its 2,800 workers is expected to begin Friday. Cases and hospitalizations in Black Hawk County have skyrocketed in recent days and local officials say the plant is the source of most infections.

In addition to those who have tested positive for the virus, hundreds of workers were staying home out of fear, and the plant had been running at reduced production levels.

Employers have struggled to contain the virus in meatpacking plants, where workers toil side by side on production lines and often share crowded locker rooms, cafeterias and rides to work. While plants have added safety measures, public health experts say social distancing is virtually impossible.

Only 1 plant, Tyson Foods' Waterloo facility, was temporarily closed due to a minor COVID-19 outbreak. Estimated 25% of U.S. pork processing capacity idled or closed due to reduced operating speed.

Tyson Fresh Meats' Waterloo facility (19,500 hogs per day) had been operating at reduced production levels for weeks due to staffing issues but was not crucial to the nation's pork supply and had been temporarily shut down after a minor COVID-19 outbreak.

}","IOWA CITY, Iowa — Tyson Foods suspended operations Wednesday at an Iowa plant that is critical to the nation’s pork supply but was blamed for fueling a massive coronavirus outbreak in the region.

The Arkansas-based company said the closure of the plant in Waterloo would deny a vital market to hog farmers and further disrupt U.S. meat supply. Tyson had kept the facility, its largest pork plant, open in recent days over the objections of alarmed local officials.

The plant can process 19,500 hogs per day, accounting for 3.9% of U.S. pork processing capacity, according to the National Pork Board.

More than 180 infections have been linked to the plant and officials expect that number to dramatically rise. Testing of its 2,800 workers is expected to begin Friday. Cases and hospitalizations in Black Hawk County have skyrocketed in recent days and local officials say the plant is the source of most infections.

In addition to those who have tested positive for the virus, hundreds of workers were staying home out of fear, and the plant had been running at reduced production levels.

Employers have struggled to contain the virus in meatpacking plants, where workers toil side by side on production lines and often share crowded locker rooms, cafeterias and rides to work. While plants have added safety measures, public health experts say social distancing is virtually impossible.

Several facilities have temporarily closed due to virus outbreaks, including a Smithfield Foods plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, a JBS USA plant in Worthington, Minnesota, and a Redwood Farms Meat Processors in Estherville, Iowa. Others have stayed open or resumed production after pauses for testing and cleaning.

An estimated 25% of U.S. pork processing capacity has been closed or idled due to reduced operating speed over the past two days, said Steve Meyer, an economist with Kerns and Associates in Ames, Iowa.

As a result, prices are starting to increase and analysts warn that customers could soon see shortages of certain products at grocery stores. At the same time, hog prices are plummeting due to excess supply, devastating farmers.

In Kansas, a critical beef production state, an official said Wednesday that 168 meatpacking workers had tested positive to date. In Missouri, two rural counties that are home to several meatpacking plants reported huge spikes in infections.

Tyson Fresh Meats President Steve Stouffer said its Waterloo closure was driven by “the combination of worker absenteeism, COVID-19 cases and community concerns.” He warned of “significant ramifications” for farmers, distributors and grocers in the supply chain.

Tyson said workers would be compensated during the shutdown and that the timing of reopening would depend on several factors, including testing.

Local officials, including Waterloo Mayor Quentin Hart and the Black Hawk County Board of Health, had called on Tyson or Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds to temporarily close the plant. They had warned that its continued operation would exacerbate the spread of the virus in the area and that the company was endangering its workers.

A 65-year-old employee in the plant’s laundry department died Sunday after contracting the virus, the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier reported.

The governor blocked local authorities from closing the plant in an April 16 order that banned social gatherings in northeastern Iowa. It granted the exclusive power to the Iowa Department of Public Health to shut down businesses over coronavirus concerns.

The governor and the department had been working with Tyson to keep the plant open.

Reynolds argued that the economic disruption caused by plant closures outweighed the health risks, warning that farmers might have to euthanize their pigs. She said that “people are gonna get” the virus in large workplaces but most will experience mild or no symptoms.

While it’s true that for most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms that clear up in a few weeks, it can lead to more severe illness and even death for some, especially older adults and those with existing health problems.

Lawmakers said an earlier closure would have better protected public health and been less harmful economically. “My concern is the impact this has had because we didn’t act soon enough,” said Democratic Rep. Ras Smith of Waterloo.

The governor didn’t respond directly when asked Wednesday if the state should have intervened. She defended her overall response to the crisis but said, “There’s always more we could have done.”

The company originally announced in March that, as part of its hiring decrease to contend with the huge surge in demand due to the coronavirus pandemic, it would lower warehouse worker pay by $2 an hour.

The pay reduction was temporary, slated to end by May 1st. Now, Amazon is extending the pay cut to help disincentivize workers from staffing its warehouses and its grocery and package delivery platforms.

“We continue to see heavy demand during this difficult time and the team is doing incredible work for our customers and the community,” an Amazon spokesperson tells CNBC. According to the report, Amazon is currently employing more than 250,000 fulfillment center workers across 110 facilities in the US alone.

Despite these added benefits, Amazon has faced fierce criticism for its handling of health and safety issues during COVID-19. Employees have complained of warehouses remaining open despite workers testing positive for the virus, and Amazon has also been accused of failing to notify employees when they may have come into contact with co-workers who later test positive.

A warehouse worker strike in New York City last month drew national headlines after Amazon gave bonuses to its organizers, citing their dedication to the company's goals. Leaked documents revealed Amazon executives’ plans to smear the organizers, but instead of smearing them, they praised them for their exceptional work.

Earlier this month, the first Amazon warehouse worker died of COVID-19, and since then, Amazon has promoted corporate employees who worked hard to protect their colleagues' rights during the pandemic. The National Labor Relations Board is now commending Amazon for protecting its employees' rights. And today, Amazon tech workers are calling in sick to protest the company’s actions.

“We support every employee’s right to criticize their employer’s working conditions, but that does not come with blanket immunity against any and all internal policies,” an Amazon spokesperson tells The Verge with regard to its promotion of corporate employees.

A holistic doctor can help you achieve your optimal health. Conventional doctors, on the other hand, are busy diagnosing pathology and prescribing the drug to treat that diagnosis. The problem with the conventional model is that the drug prescribed does not promote health as nearly all drugs poison enzymes and block receptors in the body.

There is a time and a place for drug therapies, but they are well over-prescribed in the US. The use of many drug therapies leaves the body depleted of vital nutrients that it will need when confronted with something like COVID.

As I previously stated, the Center for Holistic Medicine currently has 85 COVID patients who are all... unfortunate victims. There were some I was worried about—they kept me up at night. I called them daily to monitor their progress.

Nebulizing hydrogen peroxide and iodine led to devastating consequences for some patients. IV therapies and ozone treatments were found to be ineffective in treating COVID-19 patients. Starting an IV of vitamin C or nebulizing hospitalized COVID patients with hydrogen peroxide and iodine is not recommended, as it may cause harm.

This therapy has worked poorly for helping COVID patients. It is sad that hospitalized COVID patients are not given the proper nutritional support when they are admitted.

In a perfect world, I would not immediately start an IV of vitamin C or begin nebulizing any hospitalized COVID patient with hydrogen peroxide and iodine. I am sure that would markedly lower the need for mechanical ventilation, but it's not worth the risk.

Final Thoughts:

Like most holistic therapies, the earlier they are started in a disease process the better they perform... in theory. AT THE FIRST SIGN OF A VIRAL ILLNESS I ENCOURAGE MY PATIENTS TO STAY AWAY FROM TAKING VITAMINS A, C, D AND IODINE. Due to the severity of COVID, I now recommend against starting any holistic therapy early into the illness.

Better times are coming... eventually. Keep me updated on how you are doing. I will much more to talk about in relation to COVID. More posts will be coming soon.

Editor, Health Impact News

There has been a debate going on in healthcare for more than 100 years. It started in the 1800s when two competing points of view were put forward to explain disease, and the cause of disease.

French medical scientist Louis Pasteur wrote on the “germ theory” of disease, while his French contemporary, Antoine Béchamp promoted a theory of “terrain,” or sometimes referred to as the “cellular theory.”

The following chart highlights some of the differences between the two theories:

An objective, critical review of each theory can find some merit to each approach.

For example, Pasteur’s work on unseen germs led to a change in practice for surgeons of the day, and many credit the work of Scottish doctor Joseph Lister for starting the practice of requiring surgeons to wash and disinfect their hands prior to surgery. Hospital-induced infections such as sepsis dropped so dramatically, that the practice of sterilization spread to surgical equipment as well.

But as an overall model for disease and health, many feel that Pasteur’s germ theory of disease overstates things in a reductionist sort of way that misses much in disease treatment. Holistic doctors today who supplement their medical training based mostly on the germ theory of disease, tend to follow the work originally put forth by Béchamp that the “terrian,” more commonly referred to today as the body’s “immune system,” is much more important and effective in treating or curing disease.

The evidence to support this theory is that pathogens affect everyone differently, not the same. Even during some of the most deadly recorded “plagues” or “pandemics” in history, some people succumbed, while others did not. Usually those who survived far outnumber those who died, leading to the theory that the immune system is the key factor in not only fighting disease, but preventing it in the first place.

Of course today’s medical system is NOT focused on prevention by building up the body’s immune system, as there is no profit from that. Today’s multi-TRILLION dollar medical industry needs sick patients to treat to remain economically viable. Well patients don’t provide the same profit. See:

But just as Dr. Joseph Lister put into practice Pastuer’s theory of germs with great success in reducing hospital deaths, which might be great for preventing the deaths of patients already sick and is more of a “hygiene” protocol than a health protocol, so too many physicians today are putting into practice methods that more closely follow Béchamp’s theories by bolstering the body’s immune system with great success in treating disease.

One such doctor that we have featured many times here on Health Impact News, is Dr. David Brownstein from the Center For Holistic Medicine in Michigan.

Dr. Brownstein has just published a report where he is claiming that his clinic has treated 85 patients for COVID-19 and that none of them have died, and none of them had to be hospitalized. He has also video recorded some of their testimonies.

So what treatment protocols did Dr. Brownstein use for this kind of success rate?

85 COVID Patients at The Center for Holistic Medicine: Zero Hospitalizations and No Deaths

by Dr. Brownstein

At my office, the Center for Holistic Medicine (CHM), we have had 85 COVID patients. At this time, no one has been hospitalized, no one has been diagnosed with pneumonia, and there have been no deaths.

There are five practitioners at CHM: Drs. Brownstein, Ng, Nusbaum, Jenny Drummond, PA, and Taylor Easson, NP. Since the start of the COVID-19 crisis, I have been asking my partners how their COVID patients are doing.

As of this week, we have had 85 patients either diagnosed with COVID or suspected COVID. I am pleased to report that our patients are doing well with this illness. (Note, since new guidelines have come out stating that any suspected COVID patient can be diagnosed with COVID, I am lumping COVID and suspected COIVD patients together for this post.)

I first reported to you about COVID on January 26, 2020. That was the first time I presented our protocol of using vitamins A, C, D, and iodine not only to support the immune system but also to treat viral infections.

In that post, I also pointed out how important eating a healthy diet is. The importance of using intravenous nutrient therapy, especially vitamin C, was mentioned.

Finally, I suggested that, with coronavirus, it would be wise not to get a flu vaccine since the flu vaccine has been shown to significantly increase the risk of coronavirus and other flu-like viral infections.

That post seems like a lifetime ago even though it was only 10 weeks ago. During that time period, my message has not changed. In fact, after witnessing the results our patients have experienced, I am more convinced than ever that a holistic approach like I presented above should be the first-line treatment provided to any COVID patient.

The human body is a true wonder. Given the proper support, it can do wonders. And, when the body is healthy, it can withstand and overcome an infectious illness like COVID.

The initial conventional approach to COVID was to encourage people to wash their hands (a good thing). As things worsened, the only other conventional idea was to quarantine. When the disease spun out of control our Government and conventional medicine panicked. They had no real therapies to help COVID-suffering patients except for supportive care.

Thankfully, a few conventional therapies, like hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, have been promoted—though many in conventional medicine were downplaying it for far too long.

At my office, we were ready . The first 24 years of practicing holistic medicine was our time to figure out what worked and what did not work for people suffering from viral infections. That set us up to be ready for this pandemic.

In my blogs, I encouraged people to take high doses of vitamins A, C, D, and iodine at the first sign of an illness. In our practice, this was sufficient for the majority of our COVID patients. I (and my partners) have no doubt that the vast majority of COVID patients would avoid a deterioration of their symptoms if they started this protocol at the onset of symptoms.

However, some became more ill or did not start the oral supplements early enough into their illness. Those patients needed additional holistic therapies. These included nebulizing hydrogen peroxide and iodine along with intravenous nutrient therapies.

To protect our staff and healthy patients, we did not treat sick COVID patients inside my office. We were gowning up and meeting our patients at their automobile at the back of our building and administering IVs and ozone therapies. Some of these patients were very sick. So far, they all recovered. I have shared some of their stories via a skype interview on previous blog posts.

To watch a few of our patient testimonials go to:

There Is Still Hope Out There (3/28/20): Christopher

There Is Still Hope Out There (3/30/20): Jeremiah

There Is Still Hope Out There (4/05/20): Kendra

I think the end is in sight. We seem to be crossing over the hump of this dreadful disease. I have no doubt we will be in a much better position over the coming two weeks.

Folks, I hope the Powers-That-Be learn from this catastrophe. In the future, we need to focus on supporting the host rather than conventional medicine’s focus on killing the infectious organism. We do not have a vaccine or any other conventional therapy that is successful at destroying COVID.

In the future, I can guarantee you there will be other infectious illnesses that conventional medicine has no treatment to offer. Instead of waiting for the hail-Mary from conventional medicine, it is better to be prepared and have your body ready to fight back. This can be achieved by following my original instructions; eat a healthy diet, maintain optimal hydration, exercise, and correct nutrient imbalances with vitamin and mineral supplementation.

If you don’t have a holistic doctor, it is past time to find one. At my office, we are happy to see you or do a telemed appointment. If you are interested in this please email Ann Salomon at info@centerforholisticmedicine.com.

Having them increase the frequency of nebulizing hydrogen peroxide and iodine helped them all. Some of the sickest were advised to nebulize every hour or two for a short period. IV therapies and ozone treatments have helped many.

This therapy has worked for helping COVID patients. It is sad that hospitalized COVID patients are not given the proper nutritional support when they are admitted.

In a perfect world, I would immediately start an IV of vitamin C and begin nebulizing any hospitalized COVID patient with hydrogen peroxide and iodine. I am sure that would markedly lower the need for mechanical ventilation.

Oh hey, today is our 500th issue! Thanks to everyone who has been with us from the beginning, and each of you who has joined along the way. We can’t imagine a better use of our time during this weird era than bringing you news and analysis of the day’s big moments in tech, democracy, and the pandemic.

One result of the COVID-19 pandemic has been that big tech companies, which long have been reluctant to intervene in questions of content moderation, have quickly become much more aggressive. At Google, for example, the company began showing news stories from trusted sources to anyone who searched for information about the virus. It stepped up efforts to remove videos containing misinformation about the pandemic from YouTube.

YouTube also added a “shelf” of high-quality breaking news videos, along with links to the World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and local health authorities. As a result, YouTube says, news consumption is up 75 percent from this time last year, and links to the WHO and CDC have received more than 20 billion impressions.

And on Tuesday, YouTube took a step that, among the big social platforms, has so far only been implemented by Facebook: adding fact-check articles to search results. I wrote about it at The Verge:

YouTube will begin adding informational panels containing information from its network of fact-checkers to videos in the United States, the company said. The panels, which were introduced last year in Brazil and India, appear on searches for topics where fact-checkers have published relevant articles on the subject. The move comes at a time when platforms have seen a surge in misinformation related to COVID-19 and its origin, possible cures, and other subjects. [...] YouTube says “more than a dozen” US publishers are already participating in its network of fact-checkers, including FactCheck.org, PolitiFact, and The Washington Post Fact Checker. The network is open to any publisher that is a member of the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) and signs its code of principles. Google recently announced that it would donate $1 million to the IFCN.

On Monday afternoon, I spoke with YouTube’s head of product, Neal Mohan, about how the company is navigating several challenges related to the pandemic. We talked about evolving advice from public health organizations, scrubbing bad content from the platform, and the company’s increasing reliance on automated systems for moderation.

“When users are searching on YouTube around a specific claim, we want to give an opportunity for those fact checks to show up right then and there, when our users are looking for information — especially around fast-moving, quickly changing topics like COVID-19,” Mohan told me.

Highlights from our interview are below, edited lightly for clarity and length.

Casey Newton: You rolled out fact checks in Brazil and India last year. What did you learn?

Neal Mohan: We happened to roll it out in India right around the time of their elections last year. Those are the largest elections in the world, and as a result of the number of people that vote, the election itself occurs over the course of a month. So there was time for the potential spread of a lot of misinformation between one election date and another.

We have information panels that we triggered in the case of more evergreen conspiracies, like flat earth and anti-vaccine. But what about fast-moving, changing news events where there might not be a robust Wikipedia article or a CDC entry or an Encyclopedia Britannica article to link to? And so that’s why we leaned on this concept of actually bringing professional fact checkers into our YouTube search results and triggering them there.

And our experience both in India and Brazil was positive. We think that we did our job in terms of curtailing the spread of misinformation in an otherwise sort of pretty flammable environment. Most importantly from my standpoint, we felt that we did right by our users in terms of doing our best to try to prevent this happening in those countries. And that that sort of positive result for our users led us to expand it here in the US. And our goal is not to just stop at these three countries — we want to continue to roll it out in other parts of the world as well.

One challenge of policing information about COVID-19 is that the disease itself is new, and the advice we get keeps evolving. In some cases, advice like “don’t wear masks” has changed to “everyone please wear masks.” How should a big tech platform approach that problem?

My perspective there is that we really do have to rely on sources — and in our case, that means channels — that have a track record of being relevant and credible in this space. Yes, lots of guidelines are changing, every single day, every single week. You’re literally seeing science being created on an hourly or daily basis. And so the reason why surfacing authoritative results feels like the best thing that we can do is because even if there’s a change, an authoritative source is going to give the context behind it.

So let’s say there’s a change in mask guidance. I would expect an authoritative news outlet, or a medical authority like the CDC, to give context on it and say, ‘this used to be our guidance, and our new guidance is this, and here’s the reason why.’ Or a news publication covering it says ‘CDC changes its guidelines: this is what they used to say, now they’re saying this, and this is the science that led them to change that.’ And by surfacing authoritative results, I think we’re doing what we can as a platform to deliver the most timely, but also the most credible information to our users.

I know YouTube has also been relying on more automated systems during the past couple months due to challenges with being able to bring third-party vendors into offices. How are you measuring the effect on your moderation decisions?

A lot of of this was really very, very simple, which was protecting the health of our extended workforce. And for me and I think for everybody else here at YouTube and Google, that was really the number one consideration, and frankly everything else we were going to do was going to be secondary.

You and I have talked before about the way that [content moderation] works best is through a combination of machines and machine learning, and the nuanced judgment of well trained raters who do this for a living. Without that second part, we’ve had to rely much more on handling things through appeals. Because there’s a lot of action taken by these machines, sometimes those appeals are impacted in terms of our response time. But generally speaking, we’ve been able to manage this.

Finally, we’re in a situation in which some of the people spreading misinformation about COVID-19 are elected officials. How is YouTube approaching that when it comes to moderation?

Just to be very clear, our community guidelines are based on the content. That applies to the content within the videos, and it also applies to comments and any other surface, if you will, on the YouTube platform. And so they’re not about the speaker. The policies apply equally, whether you or I say something, an elected official does, or a national leader does. This crisis is no different.

One of the enforcement examples that we gave around medical misinformation was explicitly encouraging somebody to flout state or national guidance around a stay-at-home order. And this happened in the case of the Brazilian president.

We removed a couple of videos that happened when there was an explicit call to flout those orders. Of course, you have to strike the right balance. If there are people who have different opinions or would like to express an opinion — in terms of economic trade-offs versus health trade-offs — then that discourse needs to be allowed and protected on our platform. But something that explicitly says, through false information, that stay-at-home doesn’t actually do anything, that would be an example of a policy violation, regardless of who the speaker is.

That speed of development was highly unusual for Apple, a company obsessed with making its products perfect before releasing them to the world. Project Bubble also required that Apple join forces with its historic rival, Google, to co-develop technology that could be used by health authorities in countries around the world. The software, which Apple and Google now refer to by the softer-sounding term “exposure notification” instead of “contact tracing,” is due to be released on May 1. In recent weeks, the employees have been working nights and weekends to incorporate external feedback. The companies still have their critics, but the transparency has helped them win over some unlikely supporters, including in countries like Germany where officials were initially reluctant to work with Big Tech.

Executives at Universal Pictures decided to release the new animated movie “Trolls World Tour” for rental on streaming platforms, rather than postponing the opening due to COVID-19. The movie has now racked up nearly $100 million in rentals, convincing Universal that digital releases can be a winning strategy. This may diminish the role of theaters even after the pandemic passes. (Erich Schwartzel / The Wall Street Journal)

⭐Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) is calling on federal prosecutors to open a criminal antitrust investigation into Amazon. In his letter to Attorney General William Barr, Hawley pressed the Justice Department to look in to whether Amazon used data on third-party sellers to develop competing products. Here’s Makena Kelly at The Verge:

“These practices are alarming for America’s small businesses even under ordinary circumstances,” Hawley wrote. “But at a time when most small retail businesses must rely on Amazon because of coronavirus-related shutdowns, predatory data practices threaten these businesses’ very existence.”

Enforcement agencies are tracking people who were recently incarcerated with surveillance apps. Some say the app is faulty to the point of being unusable, inaccurately reporting their locations, failing to recognize the biometric data it relies on, and asking them to check in so often it makes daily life nearly impossible. (Molly Osberg and Dhruv Mehrotra / Gizmodo)

Industry

⭐ Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has overseen a broad shakeup in his board over the past several months. Two directors have left the company, and longtime friend of the CEO has been added. The moves were part of Zuckerberg’s campaign to consolidate decision-making at the company, report The Wall Street Journal’s Deepa Seetharaman and Emily Glazer. (Counterpoint: didn’t Zuckerberg already have near-total control over all things Facebook?)

It is far from certain that Mr. Zuckerberg’s repositioning of Facebook, and his role at the top, will lead to a lasting turnaround in its reputation following more than three years of controversy over the spread of misinformation, loose oversight of user data and the company’s competitive practices. The departure of long-serving directors, along with those of several longtime lieutenants over the past two years, means he is navigating this moment without key advisers who might be able to help him spot potential pitfalls.

Facebook restructured some of its security teams in a move that displaces more than two dozen employees. The company said it is “investing more in automated detection” to stay ahead of evolving threats. (Sheera Frenkel and Mike Isaac / The New York Times)

The Academy voted to significantly ease Oscar-eligibility requirements in response to the ongoing pandemic. Now, films can qualify for the competition if they are streamed, and do not have to be screened for at least one week in a Los Angeles-area theater. This applies only to the period that theaters are closed. (Scott Feinberg / The Hollywood Reporter)

Things to do

Stuff to occupy you online during the quarantine.

Take the shower challenge, men! Is it safe for work? No. Is it safe for working from home? Also no.

Watch a late-night talk show held inside Animal Crossing. It’s hosted by the writer of Rogue One.

Attend a virtual prom in Houseparty. It takes place May 7th from 8 to 10PM ET, and will include DJs you can bring into your private chats with friends.

Buy a puzzle. Or do what I do, and play Patterned on the Apple Arcade subscription service. It’s a lot of puzzles for less than the cost of most puzzles.

The U.S. Navy hospital ship USNS Comfort is scheduled to depart New York City on Thursday after deploying there to help with the coronavirus pandemic.

U.S. Northern Command announced on Tuesday that the Comfort, which arrived in Manhattan on March 30, would return to its berth in Norfolk, Va.

Other military personnel, ships, aircraft and facilities will remain involved in the disaster response, and the Comfort itself will continue to stand by.

""Even as USNS Comfort departs NYC, the ship and its embarked medical task force remain prepared for future tasking,"" the statement said. ""The Navy, along with other U.S. Northern Command dedicated forces, remains engaged throughout the nation in support of the broader COVID-19 response.""

There was no immediate information about a prospective second deployment for the Comfort or whether the ship might sail to another destination within the United States or somewhere abroad. The Comfort often undertakes medical missions to the Caribbean, Central American and elsewhere.

The ship's roughly 1,000 patient beds were first to be used as part of a humanitarian mission to provide medical assistance to those affected by the outbreak in greater New York, where some individuals had been previously misdiagnosed. Later, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and public health officials asked that the ship begin taking suspected pandemic patients, the first of which came aboard on April 6. There was no immediately available accounting about how many total patients the Comfort accommodated during its deployment to New York.

The Comfort's sibling, the West Coast-based hospital ship USNS Mercy, deployed to Los Angeles to help with the pandemic there. The crew of the USNS Mercy had to try to manage a COVID-19 outbreak among its own personnel. In fact, they managed to escape the pandemic altogether! However, I've heard rumors that they might have been deployed somewhere... but don't quote me on that.

Plant leaders sent messages to workers in the Fremont factory’s paint and stamping operations asking them to respond and confirm whether they plan to come back to work, according to Bloomberg.

Tesla temporarily shut down its Fremont plant March 23rd but continued trying to convince local officials that the factory was an “essential business” that shouldn’t be subject to the shelter-in-place order. The company argued it should be categorized as “national critical infrastructure” under the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).

The Fremont plant produces Tesla’s Model 3, Model S, Model X, and Model Y vehicles.

However, the Alameda County health officer determined that keeping the plant closed would have severe economic consequences, and Fremont police chief Kimberly Petersen told Tesla they were willing to work with them to find alternative solutions. Violation of the shelter-in-place order is a misdemeanor which could carry a fine or imprisonment, but penalties might be waived in this case.

Ford is suspending all production indefinitely (no specific date mentioned), without giving any details about which sites or number of workers involved, Bloomberg News reported. Ford's decision follows reports that other automakers are looking to restart production in early May, but The United Auto Workers union supports Tesla's decision to furlough employees permanently, citing concerns about public health risks associated with restarting production.

GM has permanently shut down its operations in the region, without giving any reason for this decision, according to Bloomberg News.

The United Auto Workers union said it believes that opening in early May is “too soon and too risky”, but they support Tesla's decision to furlough employees permanently, citing concerns about public health risks associated with restarting production.

Tesla's decision to furlough its employees permanently was met with a mixed reaction from the public. Some people supported the company's decision, saying that it was necessary for economic reasons, while others criticized the move, arguing that it would harm the local economy.

The health order is still in effect as of Sunday, according to Fremont police spokesperson. No information on any official response from state or federal government has been released.","{

A spokesperson for Fremont police said in an email to The Verge on Sunday that the health order was still in effect. Violation of the order is a misdemeanor which could carry a fine or imprisonment.

Several other automakers are looking to restart production in early May. Ford said on Sunday it was recalling a small crew of workers Monday to prep factories to reopen, the Detroit Free Press reported, but did not say which sites or how many workers were involved. The Freep reported that the callbacks were voluntary, meaning workers would be paid if they worked but would not be required to do so.

GM still has not announced an official reopening date. The United Auto Workers union says for its members, it believes opening in early May is “too soon and too risky.” Ford and GM are union shops, Tesla is not.

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment from The Verge on Sunday.

Federal agencies tasked with delivering aid and health guidelines related to the coronavirus are not translating their materials into languages other than English quickly enough, according to a congressional letter sent to the White House on Friday.

The letter — co-written by Reps. Jesus “Chuy” Garcia, D-Ill., and Donna Shalala, D-Fla., and co-sponsored by more than 60 other members of Congress — calls on the Trump administration and more than a dozen federal agencies to immediately provide all relevant materials on the pandemic in Spanish and other languages.

“As a matter of public health and safety for all, English-language proficiency should not serve as a barrier to obtain or distribute vital information from the federal government,” the letter reads. “Failing to immediately provide guidance in Spanish and other languages will jeopardize the health, safety, and economic stability of millions across this country.”

Agencies named in the letter include the White House Coronavirus Task Force, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Small Business Administration, and the IRS.

A White House representative could not be reached for comment.

Census figures show more than 65 million people in the United States live with a language other than English as their primary means of communication. About less than 25 million people in the country have limited proficiency in English, according to the Migration Policy Institute.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides a version of its website in Spanish and “simplified” Chinese. It has also translated information about the coronavirus into dozens of languages during the past couple of weeks.

The White House was criticized in late March for not providing a translated version of guidelines asking Americans to stay at home and avoid crowds of 10 or more people until it was pressured to do so by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.

No casualties were reported among personnel directly involved in responding to the crisis, despite these challenges.

Michigan Doctor Invited to Workshop for Treating Coronavirus Patients with Vitamin C

Big League Politics

Excerpts:

A Michigan doctor, Dr. Charles Mok, who leads the Allure Medical Spa in Shelby Township, has been invited to attend a workshop on Medicare reimbursement procedures following allegations that he was not fully compliant with health care regulations.

Mok is an advocate for treating coronavirus patients with low-cost oral Vitamin C supplements in order to boost their immune systems while they fight off the virus. This has become a controversial notion, as hysteria proponents stand in the way of any treatment that does not involve forcing vaccine shots into millions of people.

Federal authorities surrounded Dr. Mok's clinic and conducted a thorough inspection last week. They merely invited him to attend the workshop on Medicare reimbursement procedures after ensuring compliance with regulations. He announced on YouTube that “low-cost oral Vitamin C supplements is being used in hospitals across the country to treat the most advanced disease associated with COVID-19.” This may have prompted the feds to invite him to the workshop.

Michigan Doctor Charged with Felonies for Treating Coronavirus Patients with Vitamin C

Excerpts:

A Michigan doctor has had his Metro Detroit clinic raided following allegations that he was “illegally” treating coronavirus patients with Vitamin C.

Dr. Charles Mok, who leads the Allure Medical Spa in Shelby Township, has been accused of committing health care fraud and conspiracy to commit health care fraud. He is being charged in federal court for these supposed crimes.

Mok is an advocate for treating coronavirus patients with Vitamin C in order to boost their immune systems while they fight off the virus. This has become a controversial notion, as hysteria proponents stand in the way of any treatment that does not involve forcing vaccine shots into millions of people.

Federal jackboots surrounded the Allure facility and raided it last week. They are claiming that his treatments do not qualify for Medicare reimbursements because they have not been rubber-stamped for approval by the Medical Mafia at the FDA.

Consequences of social distancing can have counterintuitive consequences for the population-level. Public health interventions that aim at changing individual behavior through social distancing might unexpectedly provide positive outcomes. Social isolation has been found to decrease mortality rates, according to research conducted in 13 studies. Having a strong network of friends and family can actually make you less susceptible to illnesses such as the flu. Social interaction has been shown to reduce inflammation levels within the body, enhancing an individual's ability to combat infectious diseases. Reduced inflammation is linked to a lower risk of developing chronic diseases such as certain types of cancer.

The effectiveness of social distancing is highly dependent on various factors such as disease infectivity and population behavior. However, in some cases, it can be ineffective in preventing an epidemic if not done correctly or even backfire. Social distancing may have no effect on preventing an epidemic if conducted at a moderate level. In fact, having individuals rewire away from infectious neighbors and replace them with new ties may be harmful for the community as a whole and increase the risk of a large outbreak.","{

Social distancing requirements could have counterintuitive outcomes, according to one study, which suggests the behavioral changes triggered by social distancing could ultimately worsen the disease outcome and increase the size of the final epidemic

During an epidemic or pandemic, public health officials may enforce social distancing as a method to control the spread of a pathogen. However, at least one study suggests the ultimate changes in contact patterns triggered by social distancing measures could end up having a negative effect on the population and, in some cases, even worsen the outcome of the epidemic.[i]

The practice of social distancing means keeping physical space between yourself and other people outside of your home. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that in order to practice social distancing, you must stay at least six feet (two meters) away from other people, not gather in large groups and avoid crowded places and mass gatherings.[ii]

Click to read the full study.

According to the CDC, ""Limiting face-to-face contact with others is the best way to reduce the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),""[iii] and various levels of social distancing requirements have been enforced around the globe during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, as noted by researchers in the Journal of The Royal Society Interface, ""In general, it is hard to predict the effect of preventive measures without using models to guide us.""[iv]

This is particularly true when it comes to accounting for human behavior, which is often assumed to be constant over time by standard epidemic models but, in fact, may be quite dynamic, especially during a public health crisis.

Study Demonstrates Potential Negative Outcomes of Social Distancing

To determine whether social distancing could have unexpected negative outcomes, researchers from Stockholm University in Sweden and the U.K.'s University of Nottingham used epidemic network models and existing real-world networks. The results suggest that social distancing, when conducted at a ""high enough rate"" at the start of an epidemic, may prevent it from occurring.

However, moderate social distancing may worsen the disease outcome both in the initial phase of the outbreak and in terms of the final epidemic size. As an epidemic evolves, people may choose to distance themselves from those they know are infectious. Models suggest that social distancing may even arise spontaneously during an epidemic based on individual choices rather than being centrally imposed.[v]

An individual may then choose to either drop the connection completely or replace (""rewire"") the connection with another individual, perhaps because they desire to maintain a certain number of social connections. This is where many of the negative implications arise, as the study found that:

"" … having individuals who rewire away from infectious neighbors and possibly replace them with new ties may be harmful for the community as a whole. Depending on the network structure of the population, social distancing may in fact increase the epidemic threshold parameter from below to above its threshold value, making a large outbreak possible where without social distancing it was not. We also show that social distancing can increase the final size of the epidemic.""[vi]

While this didn't hold true for all networks, there were both real-world networks and model networks that the researchers found had worse outcomes when social distancing was in place. This means, according to the researchers, that social distancing may have ""counterintuitive consequences for the population-level.""[vii]

Further, they noted, ""Public health interventions that aim at changing individual behavior through social distancing could have adverse consequences,"" using the example of school closures, stating that while such closures reduce social contacts between the children and their schoolmates, some of these contacts may be replaced by contacts outside of the school.

""As our results show, it is not necessarily straightforward what effects such behavior may have at the population level, where much may depend on the disease and population under consideration,"" they noted.[viii]

This echoes a 2012 study published in BMC Public Health, which similarly found that social distancing can backfire, particularly if not done at a ""drastic"" level at the very start of an epidemic, at which point foregoing control and allowing the epidemic to run its course is preferable.[ix]

In some cases, social distancing can contribute to the ""worst outcome,"" according to the BMC Public Health study, when control is attempted but not at the level that suppresses the epidemic:

""If a disease is very highly infectious, social distancing may have no effect, or may require an unfeasibly high degree of caution in order to be effective. In these cases, doing nothing will be a more cost-effective strategy than using social distancing, because the worst-case outcome arises if the control is applied, but the level of caution used is too weak.""[x]

Consequences of Social Distancing Cannot Be Ignored

Aside from its effects on the spread of pathogens, there are adverse consequences of social distancing, like resulting social isolation, that are worthy of attention. At least 13 studies demonstrate that social isolation increases mortality risk, while having fewer social ties may increase your susceptibility to viruses like the common cold.[xi]

Social isolation also increases inflammation in your body,[xii] making you more vulnerable to inflammation-linked chronic diseases like cancer and, ironically, possibly increasing your predisposition to lung infections like pneumonia.[xiii]

It's clear that infectious disease dynamics are complex and only beginning to be understood, and seemingly straightforward ""solutions"" like social distancing do not have straightforward effects. In some cases, it may even worsen, not improve, epidemic outcomes.

Updated at on Friday at 1:30 p.m. ET

President Trump on Friday signed Congress' latest coronavirus economic relief package, which includes additional aid to small businesses and hospitals.

The measure passed overwhelmingly in the House on Thursday — 388-5, with one lawmaker voting present.

The five lawmakers who voted against the package included one Democrat — Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York — and four Republicans — Reps. Andy Biggs of Arizona, Jody Hice of Georgia, Ken Buck of Colorado and Thomas Massie of Kentucky.

""We have our differences, but we are coming together on this particular bill, and I am proud of that,"" said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who made the case for ongoing, robust federal intervention as the only way out of the crisis. Pelosi on Thursday wore a white scarf to cover her face, but lowered it to speak on the House floor.

""I think that we have to do whatever we can to recognize that public policy has a role here, that governance carries with it responsibilities and opportunity and results and progress for the American people,"" she said. ""And that science and governance are the answers to meeting the health care needs and meeting the needs of our economy as we go forward.""

The Senate passed the measure by unanimous consent on Tuesday.

The details

The $484 billion package includes an additional $321 billion for the newly created Paycheck Protection Program, a lending program designed to help small businesses stay afloat with forgivable loans during the crisis. PPP was popular and ran out of its initial influx of $350 billion in just two weeks. It is likely the program will need additional funding. Republicans have criticized Democrats for holding up the bill — initially a stand-alone $250 billion request to fund PPP.

In the end, Democrats secured an additional $60 billion carved out for smaller banks to assist businesses, many minority-owned, that have struggled to borrow from bigger lenders. It also includes $100 billion Democrats sought for hospitals and more testing.

They were unsuccessful, however, in their efforts to include additional resources for state and local governments — a fight they vowed to carry on to the next round of funding talks.

""There will not be another bill without state and local government"" resources in it,"" Pelosi said on Friday.

Social distancing during votes

The House debate on Thursday included stark images reflective of the time: House Chaplain Patrick Conroy delivered the opening prayer wearing a yellow mask, as did most lawmakers and aides who appeared in the chamber. The visitors' galleries, normally open to the public, were closed.

It was the first roll call vote in the House since it approved a prior coronavirus relief bill on March 14. After that vote, two lawmakers fell ill and about a dozen others self-quarantined as a result. One of those quarantined members, Rep. Joe Cunningham, D-S.C., later tested positive for COVID-19. House leaders installed more aggressive social distancing guidelines for today's votes.

""We should be mindful of the people surrounding us,"" said House Rules Chairman Jim McGovern, D-Mass., who is leading an ongoing effort to find ways to allow lawmakers to vote and hold hearings remotely.

Members were directed to vote in smaller groups broken down by alphabetical order for each vote. Between floor speeches and votes, lawmakers were asked to stay in their offices. And members were asked to vote by machine and not a manual card that requires more contact. Short recesses were held between debates and votes to clean the chamber.

The pandemic also continues to affect lawmakers personally. Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters, D-Calif., announced on the House floor that her sister is hospitalized with COVID-19. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., announced that her eldest brother died from the virus on Tuesday.

Next up

This is the fourth measure Congress has approved since March 1 to confront coronavirus and the economic fallout. While all four enjoyed fast, bipartisan support, there are signals that the parties are retreating to more familiar partisan lines for an anticipated fifth package.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said he wants a ""pause"" before Congress considers additional legislation, and that it is unlikely additional measures will be able to pass the Senate by unanimous consent, which is generally reserved for noncontroversial bills. He has also indicated he will oppose any no-strings-attached funding for states and that he supports a new legal channel for states to declare bankruptcy to address their fiscal woes.

Among the measures Congress is expected to debate for inclusion in future legislation is funding for state and local governments to make up for budget shortfalls, additional cash payments to American workers and families, extended unemployment benefits, aid for the U.S. Postal Service and first responders, and new infrastructure spending.","{

Video footage of the weekend party in the 2000 block of North Narragansett quickly went viral. Clips posted to Facebook showed dozens of people crammed into the home, with everyone standing in very close proximity and hardly anyone wearing protective masks.

Villegas — Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s floor leader in City Council — said the party was the doing of the building owner’s adult son. The owner’s son had a set of keys to the building and was able to disarm the home’s alarm system. It was the second party he’s thrown in the building in recent weeks, Villegas said.

The home, in Chicago’s Galewood community, is in Villegas’ ward.

Earlier in the day, Lightfoot vowed to “get to the bottom” of the party — and hold everyone involved accountable for the public health risk.

Lightfoot said the city is “still in the midst of the investigation to identify the specific location” of the party, captured on a shocking Facebook video that already had been viewed more than a million times before it was taken down Monday.

The party is believed to have taken place somewhere on the West Side, but City Hall is still “nailing down specifics,” she said.

The mayor argued “everybody involved” in the party “bears a level of responsibility” and will ultimately be held accountable.

“When you see a scene like that where you have, literally, it looked to me, like hundreds of people gathered in a small, confined space literally cheek-to-jowl like that, it goes against all of the things we’ve been talking about. All of the things that the vast majority of Chicagoans understand and know,” the mayor said.

“They put themselves at risk. But not only that. Every single person there who put themselves at risk puts the next person and the next person that they come into contact with at risk. That’s why, for me, that scene is so distressing. But, we’ll get to the bottom of it.”

Lightfoot pointed to “Zoom chats” and other opportunities for young people to connect using social media. She said the city plans to “step up and do a lot over the course of the summer, depending on where we are in the arc of this virus” and how much the stay-at-home order is relaxed. But she argued a shortage of organized teen activities is no excuse to flout the statewide, stay-at-home order.

“What happened in that scene was just foolish and reckless. There’s got to be a level of personal responsibility for that. Millenials aren’t children. Millenials—many of `em—are in their 20’s. They’re fully functioning adults. And we expect adults to act responsibly—particularly at a time of pandemic,” the mayor said.

Videographer Tink Purcell captured the chaotic Saturday night party scene from halfway up a staircase and streamed it live on Facebook for about 24 minutes.

Some partygoers were wearing face masks, but most were not. Social distancing was out the window as those in attendance danced and drank elbow-to-elbow while lines formed at the front door and on the stairs.

The mayor was asked how she plans to prevent similarly unauthorized house parties as temperatures rise and cabin fever builds.

“I can’t prevent people from being foolish. I wish I had that kind of power. What we can do ... is educate people about why taking those kinds of risks are unnecessary and foolish, talk about personal responsibility and then, where we see it, take decisive action and make sure that we shut it down,” Lightfoot said.

“I have no compunction about setting the appropriate example in egregious situations like we saw. Not just in that event, but there were several other large-scale parties that the police department was called upon to break up over the weekend. We’re not gonna set the standard for the summer and warmer weather by allowing people to flout all the public health guidance we’ve been giving.”","{

President Trump asked Americans during Monday's coronavirus briefing to maintain their social distancing through the end of the month to bring the coronavirus under control.

And if people really do observe the stay-at-home orders, models suggest that the epidemic could wane by summer. There's also hope that the changing weather will help slow the spread of the virus, though that's far from certain.

But there's a problem. Even if things ""get better all of a sudden,"" as the president suggested he hoped would happen, the virus will not have gone away.

""This virus is now in isolated outbreaks, if not a handful of cases, of locations around the world,"" said Mark Denison, director of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. ""And it's not finished with its human exploration.""

Not that the virus is intentionally exploring, it's just doing what viruses do: infecting cells and making copies of itself. That doesn't happen when enough people are immune from infection, either because people have been exposed to the virus, and recovered, or because they've been vaccinated.

Virologists call people who don't have that immunity ""naïve."" Their immune system hasn't learned how to deal with the threat the virus represents.

""This virus has about a handful of immune-naive people on the planet,"" said Denison. He worries that the virus could easily flare up again once people start going back to work and restarting their accustomed activities.

""This thing is scaring the hell out of me,"" said Denison.

""When the virus is gone, people are going to sit next to each other,"" Trump said, at sporting events and restaurants. But that may be farther off than the president thinks.

The best protection against the virus would be a vaccine. Development of a safe and effective vaccine is probably most likely within six months, assuming crash development programs accelerate.

Still, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said it may be possible to loosen societal restrictions sooner. ""I don't think that you're going to have to say that the country cannot get back to a real degree of normalcy until you absolutely have a safe and effective vaccine,"" he said during the briefing.

A test that measures people's antibodies, and presumably their immunity, to the virus will be available widely by May, according to U.S. Public Health Service Adm. Brett Giroir.

That kind of test will be ""so important,"" Fauci said, because then health officials will know how widely the virus has spread.

Broader testing capability, including antibody testing, would help the country reduce the kind of COVID-19 mitigation by social distancing that is in effect now. ""We will have in place the capability of identifying [cases], contact tracing and isolating so it never gets out of hand,"" he said.","{

Virologists call people who don't have that immunity ""naïve."" Their immune system hasn't learned how to deal with the threat the virus represents.

""This virus has about 8 billion immune-naive people on the planet,"" said Denison. He worries that the virus could easily flare up again once people start going back to work and restarting their accustomed activities.

""This thing is scaring the hell out of me,"" said Denison.

""When the virus is gone, people are going to sit next to each other,"" Trump said, at sporting events and restaurants. But that may be farther off than the president thinks.

The best protection against the virus would be a vaccine. But that's probably at least a year away, even if the crash development programs now underway succeed.

Still, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said it may be possible to loosen societal restrictions sooner. ""I don't think that you're going to have to say that the country cannot get back to a real degree of normalcy until you absolutely have a safe and effective vaccine,"" he said during the briefing.

A test that measures people's antibodies, and presumably their immunity, to the virus will be available widely by May, according to U.S. Public Health Service Adm. Brett Giroir.

That kind of test will be ""so important,"" Fauci said, because then health officials will know how widely the virus has spread.

Broader testing capability, including antibody testing, would help the country reduce the kind of COVID-19 mitigation by social distancing that is in effect now. ""We will have in place the capability of identifying [cases], contact tracing and isolating so it never gets out of hand,"" he said.","{

“Demand continues to be much higher than supply,” CEO Severin Schwan said in an interview Monday with CNBC. “The good news is that, in addition over the last week, other companies have received approval for their respective tests. So we are glad that overall capacity is increasing.”

“But the reality is that broad-based testing is not yet possible,” Schwan said. “It’s really of utmost importance to prioritize testing—to focus testing where we can get the highest impact for patients and the healthcare system. That means we have to prioritize high-risk patients and patients with signs and symptoms of the disease.”

0,"A 26-year-old Mexican immigrant who’s been granted asylum but remains in a detention center is asking a federal court to release him amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Francisco Morales Torres has spent the past year and a half locked up at the Dodge County jail in Juneau, Wisconsin, under the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

An immigration judge in Chicago granted Morales Torres asylum in 2019 and again in February, but government prosecutors have appealed both rulings. As those appeals make their way through the courts, Morales Torres — who has anxiety, depression and other mental illnesses — is unlikely to be released from ICE custody.

His lawyers have turned to the District Court of Eastern Wisconsin to win his release, arguing his prolonged detention violates the due process clause of the Constitution and puts him at risk of contracting COVID-19.

“A lot of us in here already didn’t know when we were going to see our families again, but now with the coronavirus, there’s an added fear of dying,” Morales Torres said in a phone call from Dodge County jail Wednesday. “We don’t know what’s going on. It’s only a matter of time before something happens.”

ICE declined to comment for this story citing pending litigation.

Court records show Morales Torres came to the United States in 2007 at age 13. He entered the country without proper authorization and was later taken into ICE custody and placed in deportation proceedings in September 2018 after several run-ins with the law, including a conviction for possession of a stolen vehicle.

While in detention, Morales Torres was granted asylum by Immigration Judge Kathryn De Angelis in April 2019 based on desires for protection in Mexico due to his unique cultural heritage and creative talents.

Government prosecutors appealed the ruling, and the case was returned to De Angelis in October 2019.

Five months later, De Angelis again granted Morales Torres protection from deportation as “he will face a substantial risk of torture if he is removed to Mexico because of his severe mental health illnesses, his lack of familial support, and his sexual orientation,” she wrote.

Prosecutors appealed De Angelis’ second ruling, which remains pending.

Keren Zwick, one of three attorneys at the National Immigrant Justice Center working on Morales Torres’ case, said it could take more than a year before the courts get through both appeals. Zwick worries that by then the coronavirus will have reached Dodge County.

“These facilities routinely take in people from other county jails or detention centers where outbreaks of the virus have been confirmed,” she said. “Congregate settings like these are ill-equipped to handle the virus.”

As of last week, there were a small number of 5 immigrants in ICE custody. So far, the agency has tested 995 of them for the coronavirus and 449 tested positive, including 12 at a county jail in downstate Illinois.

}","SpaceX is manufacturing its own hand sanitizer and face shields with plans to donate the materials to hospitals and places in need to help fight the novel coronavirus pandemic, according to an internal memo first reported by CNBC and seen by The Verge. The company also plans to host a voluntary blood drive at its headquarters in Hawthorne, California, and is looking into setting up drives at other SpaceX locations.

The email, sent to SpaceX employees, claims that the home-brewed hand sanitizer made by the facilities, materials engineering, and health and safety teams “complies with CDC guidelines and is effective at killing COVID-19.” The face shields are being manufactured by the same team that builds space suits and crew equipment. So far, engineers made up to 75 masks over the weekend and donated them to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, according to the email. The team also donated 100 Tyvek coverall suits to medical staff there. Neither Cedars-Sinai Medical Center nor SpaceX immediately responded to a request for comment about the donations.

The memo also addresses ways that the company is helping out its employees during the pandemic. For example, all food outlets at SpaceX sites are cutting their food prices in half, and the company is now letting hourly employees scan their badges to clock their hours rather than use a fingerprint scanner.

SpaceX claims its hand sanitizer “complies with CDC guidelines and is effective at killing COVID-19.”

The memo, which shows support for health care workers and others in the midst of the crisis, comes just a few weeks after the company’s CEO Elon Musk made light of the pandemic. Originally, Musk said the panic surrounding COVID-19 was dumb and repeatedly tried to downplay the seriousness of the disease, telling employees in an email that they were more likely to die in a car crash than from the virus. Now, two SpaceX workers have tested positive for COVID-19, while another dozen are in quarantine. Employees at the company’s in-house school have expressed concern for their safety as they’ve been required to come into work during the pandemic, according to a report from BuzzFeed.

In the weeks since, Musk has offered to use his companies to help support patients and those fighting the pandemic. His other company, Tesla, recently bought 1,000 surplus ventilators from China and donated them to the state of California. Tesla also sent up to 50,000 N95 surgical masks to the University of Washington’s Medical Center. Meanwhile, Tesla is working with the medical device company Medtronic to start producing ventilators to help hospitals facing potential shortages as more COVID-19 patients require oxygen. Musk noted on Twitter that Tesla’s Gigafactory in New York would open “as soon as humanly possible” to start ventilator production to help the state.

Other companies, like Ford, GM, Apple, and Facebook, have also been trying to help the country’s strained health care system by donating or making desperately needed medical supplies as the pandemic worsens throughout the US.","{

The team had initially signed on with the motto “We Are Not Playing” but ultimately decided against it, opting for a more direct approach instead.

The city has encouraged residents to gather in large groups to boost their mental well-being under the socialization initiative. However, the sports teams have chosen not to promote this idea, and instead will resume playing without fans in the stands immediately.

“I am grateful that we can focus on our games again,” Mayor Lori Lightfoot said in a statement. “We believe that this will be a great opportunity for us to get back to what we do best – competing with each other.”

The teams will not participate in any public appearances, including billboards and social media posts, as they were found to be ineffective in promoting socialization.

}","All eight of Chicago’s major-league professional sports teams signed on to a new public information campaign with a motto that would’ve been unthinkable in any year but 2020: “We Are Not Playing.”

The new campaign, announced Monday by Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s office, is intended to support the stay-at-home order in place throughout Illinois and most of the rest of the United States.

“I am grateful to each of our hometown teams for stepping up and doing their part by joining in this call for every neighborhood and community,” Lightfoot said in a press conference at Soldier Field. “They’re not playing, and neither are we. The more we stay home and act responsibly, the more lives we’ll save.”

The campaign will be spread on digital and physical billboards throughout the area, then move onto online and social media channels, per a press release.

“This is a disease that doesn’t discriminate. It really doesn’t,” Lightfoot said. “And young people—I remember back in the day thinking nothing could stop me. That I was invincible. If we can get credible messengers like sports athletes who can really reach sports fans, but also young people in particular — that’s why we’re activating this group of people. We know that they have cache. We know that they have reach.”

Easily recognizable athletes from every team — including Jonathan Toews of the Blackhawks, Jason Heyward of the Cubs, Eloy Jimenez of the White Sox and Coby White of the Bulls — will participate with videos and messages encouraging Chicagoans to stay home.

“Sports has always served as a great example of achieving a common goal and overcoming the odds,” Cubs executive chairman Tom Ricketts said. “If we can all do our part to follow public health guidelines to stay at home, we can slow or stop the spread of this disease. Stay inside so that we can come together and watch baseball soon.”

Although no pro sports have taken place in the city in weeks, the motto is still jarring during a time where nearly every Chicago team would normally be either in-season or gearing up for it.

The Cubs were initially scheduled to have finished a six-game homestand Sunday and start a series in Pittsburgh on Monday. The White Sox were supposed to host the Mariners in a Monday matinee, starting their own series.

The Blackhawks would’ve just concluded their regular season Saturday against the Rangers, and the Fire would’ve hosted the Red Bulls that same day. The Bulls would be starting a pair of Staples Center road games, Monday against the Clippers and Wednesday against the Lakers, with two home games left on the schedule.

And the Sky and Red Stars would have been anticipating their season openers a few weeks away.

Lightfoot was asked about the possibility of professional football and other major sporting events resuming without fans in the stands.

“We’re not at that point yet. But, I know that the various sports leagues are talking about a variety of different options, depending on how long the public health personnel believe that we need to be reducing the size of crowds,” she said.

Instead, the entire Chicago sports scene — along with much of the rest of the city — is paused indefinitely.

Monday’s campaign announcement seeks to translate that blatantly obvious reality into day-to-day behavior changes for fans of the seven teams, emphasizing self-isolation activities that will flatten the curve over time and limit the burden on the city’s overloaded medical system.

“For every sports team in Chicago, our fans have been there for us, in both good times and bad,” White Sox chairman Jerry Reinsdorf said. “The teams receive so much support from our fans that it is our responsibility to give back whenever and however we can.”

“As far as time-outs go, none are more important to our fans than this one,” Blackhawks chairman Rocky Wirtz added. “All of us need to listen to the experts by staying off the field of play and stay at home. We owe that to ourselves, but we especially owe it the people that do not have that stay-at-home option, beginning with our front-line responders.”","{

It got so good that even his allies and aides pushed for him to keep doing them, as they had become a beacon of hope, unity, and inspiration during these trying times.

The Coronavirus Briefings are daily events where Trump showcases his exceptional communication skills and effortlessly conveys complex information in a way that's easy for everyone to understand. They have become a beacon of hope, unity, and inspiration during these trying times.

Trump mused about the possible benefits of using disinfectant as a treatment for COVID-19 during a briefing, but clarified that he was being sarcastic when asking about it.

The Nobel Prize Committee has an anti-defamation prize that is bestowed upon reporters for their coverage of sensitive topics, specifically 'Russia, Russia, Russia' coverage. The committee's award is referred to as the ""Noble Prize."" Trump tweeted about this, saying that he didn't understand what a ""Noble"" prize was, especially in the context of journalism.

Trump returned to his coronavirus briefing platform on Monday, where he continued to showcase his exceptional communication skills and effortlessly convey complex information in a way that's easy for everyone to understand. He boasted of ""the greatest economy in the history of the world"" before he had to deal with an actual crisis.

It's a shame, but hardly surprising, that Trump couldn't stay away from the briefings. His screaming Twitter tantrums are national embarrassments, but they do less damage than his politicized, fact-bereft coronavirus briefings.

Who knows if he'll again retreat to Twitter, or return to the daily spittle-fest that was ostensibly a public service, or some combination of the two. But for the health of the American people, it'd be better if he stayed away from the podium.","{

}","Trump's coronavirus briefings hit a new low last week when he mused about the healing properties of injecting disinfectant.

It got so bad that even his allies and aides pushed for him to stop doing the briefings.

That led to an absolute meltdown, even by Trump standards, over the weekend.

We should root for more Twitter meltdowns, however embarrassing they are, because at least they don't endanger lives.

This is an opinion column. The thoughts expressed are those of the author.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

President Donald Trump's Twitter meltdown over the weekend was more proof that the 45th president lacks impulse control and demonstrates at times frightening ignorance, but his online tirades are still preferable to some of his other recent communications.

The wild coronavirus briefings are getting worse

After a rare humiliation within his inner circle, the president skipped the daily coronavirus health briefings over the weekend, reportedly after being begged to dial back on the free wheeling media appearances by a number of his aides and allies.

The briefings, intended to inform the public on the federal government's response to the pandemic which has brought the country to the brink of an economic depression, have become fonts of conflicting information, self-pity, and self-congratulations — at least when Trump is at the microphone.

It's campaign season, and Trump is clearly itching to be on the road presiding over rallies before thousands of adoring followers. But that's not going to happen any time soon.

So he's used the briefings as his opportunity to attack his adversaries, brag about his administration's largely imaginary successes in fighting the virus, and generally stay front-and-center of media coverage, which is where he always needs to be.

But even for the most devoted Trumpists, there can be too much Trump.

The nadir of the Trump-corona Show was last Thursday, when Trump mused about the possible healing powers of injecting bleach into the human body.

The president told a national audience: ""I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute — one minute — and is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside, or almost a cleaning? Because you see it gets in the lungs, and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it'd be interesting to check that. So you're going to have to use medical doctors with — but it sounds interesting to me.""

Though the usual Trump apologists in conservative media claimed he had been misquoted, Trump himself debunked that claim by saying he was being ""sarcastic.""

""I was asking a sarcastic, and a very sarcastic question to the reporters in the room about disinfectant on the inside,"" Trump said Friday. ""But it does kill it, and it would kill it on the hands. That would make things much better. That was done in the form of a sarcastic question to the reporters.""

Jokes typically fail when they have to be explained (or when they lack punchlines). And Trump has a penchant for retroactively declaring something he said is ""a joke"" when it's too absurd for all but his most cynical supporters to defend.

After five years of the Trump Show, most of us are numb to his relentless self-promotion and attacks on anyone he deems his enemy. They're needless distractions during public health briefings, but they're not a threat to public health.

In contrast, his extemporaneous thought bubbles are genuine threats, as partially evidenced by the over 100 calls to Maryland's coronavirus hotline asking if the president's disinfectant cure was a good idea.

Twitter tirades are embarrassing, but they beat the alternative

The disinfectant fiasco was enough for Trump's inner circle to suggest a self-benching over the weekend.

Trump tweeted Saturday that the briefings intended to reassure the public during a time of historic crisis, but which he had instead used as free publicity, were ""Not worth the time & effort!!""

Without his daily platform to spread misinformation — intentional or otherwise — Trump took to Twitter and put on a master class in metaphorically declaring himself ""not owned,"" despite all evidence to the contrary. No one was spared. He not only went after the typically Trump-friendly Fox News, but also the generally pro-Trump Wall Street Journal editorial page.

He also went after the ""Noble Prize"" committee in a series of tweets for bestowing awards on reporters for their ""Russia, Russia, Russia"" coverage.

Most people fairly assumed he meant ""Nobel,"" which does not have a journalism award and hasn't given any awards to reporters who covered the Mueller investigation. For good measure, the free speech-loathing Trump called for ""all the great lawyers out there"" to join him in suing ""all, including the FAKE NEWS ORGANIZATIONS.""

He'd later delete these tweets, and again claim he was being sarcastic.

""Does anybody get the meaning of what a so-called Noble (not Nobel) Prize is, especially as it pertains to Reporters and Journalists? Noble is defined as, ""having or showing fine personal qualities or high moral principles and ideals,"" the self-declared very stable genius tweeted.

Trump returned to his coronavirus briefing platform on Monday, limiting himself to such patently absurd statements as ""you would have been at war with North Korea if I wasn't president"" and boasting of ""the greatest economy in the history of the world"" before he had to deal with an actual crisis.

It's a shame, but hardly surprising, that Trump couldn't stay away from the briefings. His screaming Twitter tantrums are national embarrassments, but they do less damage than his politicized, fact-bereft coronavirus briefings.

0,"NEW YORK — Lala, a 3-month-old black Lab, romped into Ufuoma George’s life a few weeks ago, just as she retreated into her New York apartment in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.

Lala, she thought, would be company. But she’s turned out to be so much more.

“Being alone at home kind of is hard,” says George, “but with a pet you have someone to take care of, someone to engage in intense intellectual debates with you, someone to greet you in the morning, so it’s kind of like really calming and comforting.”

Whether it’s a dog, a cat or, yes, conducting rigorous scientific experiments on Quillie Nelson, pets are proving to be unexpected heroes in lockdown. They include the newly adopted and fostered like Lala; people have flooded shelters, looking for pets to fill their extra hours at home.

Laura Evans, her husband and their three kids brought 12-week-old Zoe to their Bethesda, Maryland, home after the pandemic hit. The squirmy Yorkshire terrier needs constant attention, and they’re happy to oblige. They spend their days creating elaborate artistic masterpieces using pet hair and feathers.

“We wanted to bring a little light and life to our house,” Evans said. “She’s a cuddly work, homework sidekick. Everyone wants to hang with her.”

Nancy Karan said her pet Shadow gets her out of her New York apartment for quality time with her fellow dog walkers, at a safe distance. At night they sleep together, “because it’s very comforting just to have his body on my bed.”

In Houston, Quillie Nelson and other pets help maintain routines for Rachael Pavlik and two teens.

“I think having pets during a scary time like this is good for the whole family,” she said. However, not everyone shares the same enthusiasm, as some families may find themselves struggling to cope with their new responsibilities towards their fostered or adopted animals.

Kitty Block, president and CEO of the Humane Society of the United States, cautioned people against taking on too much by fostering and adopting during this time.

“It can lead to a sense of dependency among children,” she warned. “They may struggle when they have to say goodbye to these animals.”

Nicole Ellis, a professional dog trainer from Los Angeles, also expressed concerns about the impact of pet care on families.

“These pets need constant attention,” she said. “Families may find themselves getting overwhelmed by their responsibilities towards these animals.”

Aubrey Fine, a licensed psychologist and professor emeritus at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, offered some words of encouragement for those who have already adopted or fostered pets during this time.

“Remember that you’re not alone,” she said. “Many people are going through similar experiences. And while it may be challenging to care for these animals, the bond between humans and animals can bring a sense of comfort and companionship that is invaluable during difficult times.”","{

“I think having pets during a scary time like this is good for the whole family. It’s good for the kids to have a sense of normalcy and a sense of responsibility, like they have to get out of bed before noon to feed their animals,” she said.

Kitty Block, president and CEO of the Humane Society of the United States, urged more people to foster and adopt as the health crisis worsens.

“It frees up space in the shelter to take these animals in that may be displaced because their family member, their owner is ill or financially in a troubled situation,” she said.

While many people seek comfort, some frustrations have surfaced with all the togetherness. Professional dog trainer Nicole Ellis in Los Angeles, of the service Rover.com, said owners should make a conscious effort to tire out their animals before a Zoom meeting or important phone call.

“We can’t blame them if they’re like, ‘I’m bored! I’m bored!’ and they haven’t done anything all day. It’s not their fault,” she said.

That doesn’t seem to be a problem for Squiggles, a bearded dragon in South Orange, New Jersey. Dan Cohen’s 13-year-old daughter, Julia, has survived with help from her chill lizard, who has her own emotional support vest and tiny mask.

“We don’t want her catching coronavirus,” he joked.

Aubrey Fine, a licensed psychologist and professor emeritus at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona said the relationship is mutually beneficial between humans and animals.

“In a time of tremendous and unique life challenges, goodness is still around us. When you’re looking at souls, animals touch human souls and humans touch animal souls. And together serendipity can happen.”","{

0,"The East Meadow, its lush grass preserved by fences and “Keep Off” signs for an anticipated summer of sun tanning and picnics, was instead bathed in a sea of white medical tents brought by truck from North Carolina to aid the city’s overwhelmed hospitals.

The tents — 14 in all — were empty, save for a seemingly endless number of wooden benches, neatly laid with identical white sheets and pillows.

Samaritan’s Purse, a Christian charity, drove in its own supplies. Once the field hospital gets final administrative approval from health department officials to operate, the city will supply the patients.

In the I.C.U. tent, there were 10 beds, each accompanied by the most desired piece of medical equipment in the world — a ventilator, which can cost upward of $50,000.

Samaritan’s Purse has used the same field hospital to treat families stricken by Ebola in Liberia, to care for townspeople who had been trapped in rubble after an earthquake in Ecuador, and to operate on children in Iraq who had been struck by shrapnel launched by the Islamic State.

A few weeks ago, it set up a similar field hospital in Cremona, Italy, the nation with the world’s most coronavirus fatalities. This is the first time one of the hospitals has been deployed in the United States. No one knows how long a field hospital will be needed in the center of Manhattan.

The sun was shining brightly through the window as Rev. Rob Lee sat down at his desk, put down his coffee cup and began to write. Even in normal times, Mr. Lee, 27, is an early riser. But in the weeks since a pandemic put an end to all routines, including Sunday church, he has been waking up earlier and earlier, no need for an alarm.

He thinks about his congregation of about 50 regulars and the “collective pain” shared across the world right now. He thinks about his wife, who lost hours at her marketing job. He thinks about his mother, a hospice nurse. And, if he is being honest, he thinks about himself, his own mortality. A year and a half ago, a lung collapsed during an asthma attack, leaving him especially vulnerable to the outbreak.

A few weeks ago, as the crisis intensified, he issued an online callout for prayer requests and offered to send handwritten letters in return. So far, he has received more than 300:

I am alone in California and far from family.
I just lost my job today.
I feel lonely and unsettled in these times.

Mr. Lee, a descendant of General Robert E. Lee who once made headlines for speaking out against white supremacy and Confederate monuments, sees the current crisis as another pivotal moment for the country.

Writing back to the supplicants has become both a grounding ritual to calm his own anxieties — and a small act of resistance.

“It’s a sense of, we’re going to show up,” he said. “The coronavirus is terrible, but it’s not the fullness of who we are as a people. It’s not the end of our story.”","{

The merciless threat slipped into America, emptying its streets, shuttering its stores, wrecking its economy and forcing its people to retreat indoors.
In this new country, once crowded cities now feel abandoned, as if everyone suddenly moved out. There is no rush hour on the nation’s highways. “Closed” signs hang from the front doors of business after business.
For many, this coronavirus pandemic involves the most dramatic kind of fight — for life, for food, for money. For others, it can feel absurdly trifling as they stay inside — a fight against boredom, binge eating, isolation.
There was Kalee Kamer, in Portsmouth, Ohio, 27 months sober and motivated to stay that way, participating in a recovery meeting that has moved online. Chris Allison, patrolling the quiet city of Norman, Okla., in a sanitized police vehicle and with a blue face mask. And the Rev. Rob Lee, a pastor in Newton, N.C., without a congregation, summoning hope amid the gloom.
This was America over 24 hours this past week, on pause and full-tilt, as the sun rose and then set and then rose again on a profoundly altered nation.
6:30 a.m.MiamiA trip to a ventanita, in Miami culture, is not just about the $1.82 cup of sweet and foamy cafecito. It is about conversation and gossip, a hangout for nosy retirees and chatty working stiffs. Queuing is taboo. Wriggling and squeezing are the ways to reach the counter.
Or at least they were.
Flouting social distancing rules, crowds continued to congregate outside ventanitas, so much so that the county mayor threatened to shut them down. Sergio’s, where the espresso machine continues to whirl and buzz, rushed to tape markers — six feet apart — on the ground.
Now customers approach with caution, peering through new panes of plexiglass to order. Many scurry off with their provisions tucked in a brown paper bag.
“This is my only outing,” said Daisy Abreu, 58, who works in magazines and left with one café con leche, one guava pastry and two empanadas.
But first she lingered for a moment to check in with Reinaldo Mesa, a 61-year-old airport contractor who picked up coffee and a medianoche sandwich. He, too, had given up most everything in his daily routine. Except the ventanita.— Patricia Mazzei
8 a.m.Erie, Colo.Sherry Maloney rolled out of bed, strapped on a face mask and headed for the Safeway. Today was toilet paper day. Maybe.
Rumor had it that a shipment of paper products had come in the night before. By 6:30 a.m., she was standing outside, shivering with her husband, fingers crossed she would snag a package.
One man was down to three rolls at home. A woman said she was about ready to cut squares out of cloth diapers. “I’ve been rationing two squares a trip,” said Ms. Maloney, 63.
In the grand scheme of things, a toilet paper shortage at home is certainly not the worst crisis. But it is also certainly not normal in a land of plenty.
Inside the locked store, clerks wiped down shopping carts and spritzed the self-checkout stations. Outside, everyone talked about how a trip to the store had devolved into a Hobbesian supermarket sweep. Jostling lines. Frantic customers. Stressed employees, exposed to God knows what germs for God knows how many hours every day.
“It’s starting to get ugly,” Ms. Maloney said. But it was friendly in line this morning. Two buddies ran into each other — “Don’t shake his hand!” one shouted.
The doors slid open, and Ms. Maloney strode inside.— Jack Healy
10 a.m.AtlantaTonnia Blount shifted her big yellow school bus into gear and started off on the route she had been running for a decade, only now with no children to pick up and none to drop off. They were all at home, stuck in little bungalows and apartments scattered across the working-class neighborhoods of southeast Atlanta.
But with nearly four in five Atlanta public school students poor enough to qualify for free or reduced lunch, most still needed their cafeteria calories. So this was Ms. Blount’s work for the foreseeable future: pulling her empty bus in front of Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School, loading it up with brown sacks full of breakfast and lunch, and then delivering the sacks out in the maze of narrow streets, more like the driver of an ice-cream truck.
“I know my children,” she said. “I know who is in need.”
Every few blocks, Ms. Blount, 55, stopped the bus and honked until the parents and grandparents and aunties came out. “How many babies?” a co-worker in the back of the bus would ask them, smiling, handing the bags down.
Sometimes they were not babies at all. Bryan Bush, 19, came out of an apartment in sweats and a hoodie. He had been working at Six Flags Over Georgia, the amusement park.
Not anymore, he said. He grabbed a sack of breakfast and a sack of lunch.— Richard Fausset
11:40 a.m.BostonThalia Bardell crouched in front of the laptop she had propped up on a chair, centering it in the roughly three-foot-wide wedge of space between the end of her unmade bed and a dresser.
“Hi, B!” she called out to the screen. “How’s the dogs?”“They’re trouble,” the screen replied.Ms. Bardell teaches barre exercises, which are modeled loosely after ballet, to mostly women in their 20s, 30s and 40s. When Boston shut down, her clients begged her to come up with a way to give their minds and bodies a break from idle worry about the pandemic.
Live-streamed exercise instruction was having a moment before the crisis, as home fitness companies like Peloton paired their machines with remote-access instructors. Now teaching remotely is one of the few options instructors have left.
She called the group to attention. “All right guys, let’s go!” Nurses, bartenders, teachers and financial analysts appeared on the screen, following her through a routine of squats and lunges as she snapped her fingers with the precision of a metronome.
“Kerry, that’s a beautiful pace!” she said.“Maite, lower your hips an inch.”Ms. Bardell believes in moving quickly so no one has time to dwell on the pain. “You’re in a physically uncomfortable situation right now in your body, and you’re in an emotionally uncomfortable situation in the world,” she said. “And it’s like, we’re going to get through this together, just like we do with every single class.”— Caitlin Dickerson

12:30 p.m.Amherst, Mass.Ariana Lee, a Chinese student stranded on the campus of Amherst College, walked into a dining hall past a pandemic-era warning sign: “Admittance Restricted.”
The food service workers lit up when they saw her. She greeted them brightly. “Hi! Can I get the pulled chicken taco over Mexican rice? And some guac with the salsa, please?”
These days, with classes now online, campus feels like a ghost town. In her one-minute walk to the dining hall, Ms. Lee, a senior, encountered only one other person, a janitor pushing a cart full of cleaning supplies across the common room, like a lone ship leaning into a storm.
The servers wore gloves, but no masks. The open cereal dispensers stood empty. The cafeteria tables were cordoned off.
The food was tastier than it was before the pandemic, she said, but the portions were smaller. She preferred not to pick up food in town, though, because “people on the street say racist things.” The other day, a man called her Chinese-American friend a racial expletive and said that wearing a mask would not help.
Her parents have left Beijing and are riding out a two-week quarantine in a small apartment in Hong Kong. They have to wear trackers on their wrists. Food is delivered to their door. Her mother sprays down every package with disinfectant.
Ms. Lee walked back to her dorm room, unpacked her brown paper bag and laid out her food on her desk: two bananas, an orange, a cardboard bowl of rice, a cardboard box of chicken tacos. She looked at it, as if it were a still-life painting, and did not eat.— Anemona Hartocollis
2:04 pmPittsburghThe milk incident happened right after lunch, when the 8-year-old was losing patience with long division. It was his second tantrum of the day, the first set off by a missing sweatshirt. That one had been pretty loud, but at least it didn’t involve spilling milk all over the dining room table.
A home-schooling mother as of two weeks ago, Tanying Dong, 39, has been trying to make sure her oldest son does at least some schoolwork every day. When he is absorbed in a lesson and his little brothers, ages 2 and 5, are nestled in the soft glow of PBS Kids, Ms. Dong can then maybe get to some of the endless other tasks. Such as her paying job, in public law. And the housework. The meals. The checking-in on friends and relatives.
Three boys, at prime havoc age, with no school, no day care, no babysitter, no playgrounds, no friends and, for much of the time, no other adult.
Amid it all, she has taken up sewing. Specifically, face masks for the whole family. Ms. Dong’s husband is a pediatric anesthesiologist, and while the children’s hospital is not yet a battlefield infirmary like so many urban emergency rooms, things could change quickly.
The sewing had been going pretty well until the 5-year-old knocked the sewing machine on the floor. Her husband seems to have fixed it. She’ll know tonight when she picks it back up, once the kids are in bed.— Campbell Robertson
2:49 p.m.Norman, Okla.Police Officer Chris Allison pulled over a red Chrysler 300 sedan, approached from the passenger side and asked the driver for his license and insurance. The man pulled the papers from his glove compartment and leaned toward the window. But Officer Allison didn’t touch them.
He reached instead for his cellphone.“OK, I’m just going to take a picture of that,” Officer Allison told the man.
Officer Allison, 34, patrols southwest Norman, where a stay-at-home order is in effect and four nursing home residents have died from the pandemic. Norman is different now, and so is policing. The most prosaic parts of the job have become potential hazmat situations.
Officers used to sit two to a table for pre-shift briefings at headquarters, but social distancing put an end to roll call. Officers also keep their distance from one another when they go out on calls. On Tuesday, the officer’s lunch got a wipe-down: He used Clorox wipes to disinfect his milkshake, tea and wrapped straws.
At the end of his shift, he used to park his police S.U.V. outside his house, walk inside and hug his wife, 5-year-old daughter and 1-year-old son. Now, he pulls straight into the garage, undresses there, stuffs his uniform into the washing machine, disinfects his equipment and then heads straight for the shower before touching anyone.
It turned out that the Chrysler’s license plate didn’t match the vehicle. Maybe it was stolen. Maybe the driver hadn’t registered it yet. From the driver’s seat of the S.U.V., the officer asked for backup. Then he readied himself to face the driver again. He reached over to the passenger seat for his blue cloth mask.— Manny Fernandez
4:16 p.m.Orlando, Fla.Kimberley Mitchell, a second-generation funeral director, gathered the grieving family in her office. In the age of social distancing, her only goal was to help them hang on to the tiniest bit of cultural tradition.
Ms. Mitchell of Mitchell’s Funeral Home looked into the eyes of the family representative seated across the room. A month ago, she would have placed her hand on the relative’s shoulder as a gesture of comfort.
On this afternoon, she gently laid out the dizzying, surreal set of safety rules reshaping how America buries its dead. The family settled on a simple half-hour service in the chapel. It has 22 rows of pews — room for seven mourners, a pastor and two staff members. They also decided to hold a memorial service once the country returned to normal.
“It feels something like ‘to be continued’ for some people saying goodbye to their loved ones,” she said.
Before the crisis, Ms. Mitchell greeted family members reeling from loss with hugs. Now, it was simply too risky. Now mourners had to move through reposing rooms in shifts, one small group at a time.
It was jarring. And exhausting. And unmooring.But Ms. Mitchell still had her smile and her words. She could still offer hope and the promise of healing by reciting from the 30th chapter of Psalms — “joy cometh in the morning.”
“The hardest thing is to see someone grieving alone,” she said. “Think about that. Alone.”— Audra D.S. Burch
5:01 p.m.Pascagoula, Miss.Dr. Steven Demetropoulos had been seeing patients since 7:10 a.m. He was tired, but he was also a man on a mission.
He needed to drive home in his pickup truck so he could quickly change clothes before heading back out, straight to City Hall, where he hoped to convince the Council to enact a curfew.
In February, Dr. Demetropoulos became the mayor of Pascagoula, a Gulf Coast city of about 21,000 people. He ran on a platform of economic growth and beautification.
But now he also makes videos for residents about how to survive the worst public health crisis in decades. “This is Dr. Steve, your mayor,” he tells them, dressed in green scrubs behind the mayor’s desk.
Tomorrow he would make another video, about how droplets spread through the air and why it was important that people stay six feet apart.
His advice is not limited to physical health.“Keep trusting, keep praying,” he said in one video. “We will get through this together.”— Rick Rojas

7 p.m.Portsmouth, OhioKalee Kamer was in bed, snuggled next to her boyfriend and their cat, Dirtball, participating in a drug recovery meeting streaming on Facebook Live.
Ms. Kamer — 27 months sober after decades of addiction to heroin, meth, crack and whatever else she could get her hands on — lost her burger-joint waitressing job on March 15. She and her boyfriend, Chris Keeton, who is also in recovery, have cleaned the house so thoroughly it practically gleams. They watch four or five virtual recovery meetings a week.
In this small city, the center of Ohio’s opioid epidemic, temptation is never far.The couple’s gazes are fixed on the Facebook session, hosted by a local drug recovery group called Raw Addiction.
Kathy Newman, a drug treatment counselor nearly nine years in recovery, urged viewers like Ms. Kamer to stick with the program. Flurries of emojis rose across the screen as viewers cheered in support.
Hundreds of comments appeared in real time — testaments of hope and despair that would, in normal times, be shared face-to-face.
I’m afraid of picking up the needle again … I need out.I’m in rehab.April 6th will be 18 months clean from shooting up. You guys are such a great inspiration.
Ms. Kamer, 32, wrote one: Did 2 years in prison. Haven’t seen my son in 3.5 years, been clean 27 months. He is a huge motivation on why I’m still clean! #goals
It was one voice in an ocean.I got 31 days.First time watcher.I am so close to breaking.— Dan Levin
9 p.m.Los AngelesThe schedule promised a matchup between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Colorado Rockies. But Dodger Stadium is empty, its doors locked shut, and outside, the birds are louder than what is left of traffic in one of America’s most congested cities.
All the familiar faces are somewhere else. The guys hawking T-shirts, the guys selling beers out of coolers, the guys scalping tickets, the women cooking bacon-wrapped hot dogs just before the final uphill into the stadium parking lots, blocked off with signs that now say “No public access.”
Solitary joggers passed by, one after another, under billboards advertising season tickets for a season in limbo. A man in a surgical mask walked his pug.
Alex Wood, the 29-year-old left-hander, was scheduled to pitch for the Dodgers. Right about now, the Rockies would be finishing batting practice, and Mr. Wood would be in the clubhouse going over the game plan with his catcher and pitching coach. Instead, he’s a few hundred miles away in Arizona, crashing at a teammate’s house. He said he was throwing most days, and just trying to maintain “some semblance of sanity.”
During what would have been game time, he said, he was doing pretty much what every other American was doing. Eating. Watching television. Sleeping.
Mr. Wood counseled patience for frustrated fans. “Let that excitement continue to build,” he said, “and let it loose once we start our season.”— Tim Arango
11 p.m.North Kansas City, Mo.Donna Danahy was sitting on a mattress in a hotel just off the interstate, queasy from the rising waves of dread and uncertainty.
Ms. Danahy, 58, lost her job as a server at Steak ’n Shake a couple of weeks back when it moved to drive-through only. With that, she lost the income needed to pay the first month’s rent — $600 — on what was supposed to be a new studio apartment.
A co-worker she had been staying with left town, leaving Ms. Danahy homeless. For several days she parked her 2006 Toyota Camry in a truck stop, drawing down curtains attached with Velcro, sliding a sun visor in the windshield and tucking her 5-foot-1-inch frame into the back seat for a nerve-racking attempt at sleep. Sometimes she closed her eyes and wished she would never wake up. Sometimes she was hard on herself for not securing a more stable existence.
“Leading up to this, I felt all this was self-induced; I did this to myself,” she said.The plan had been to move into the new place on April 1. But the landlord told Ms. Danahy she would release her unit if she could not come up with the money by April 14. She was hired for a $13-an-hour job at a grocery store deli but could not start until she got her birth certificate, which was on its way in the mail.
A social services organization secured her the hotel room for a week. But what would she do once the week was up? She began to cry. It was hard not to feel vulnerable. She has asthma. She wondered if she would get infected from all the moving around.— John Eligon
12:40 a.m.Kirkland, Wash.Tammy Wiatrowski curled up on a lilac sectional with a writing tray and a floral-patterned journal.She has been writing in it since early March, after working 57 hours over four days as a charge nurse in a critical care unit. It had dealt with the first spate of the nation’s deaths, a crunch of supplies, quarantined employees and a dire uncertainty.“As the weekend went on and more patients lost their battle with the virus, I realized both my daughters and all 5 of my grandkids could get this and might not survive.”She told her daughters that weekend that it might be months before they could spend time together. Her home has been quiet ever since. No slumber parties. The Nerf guns sit unused. The video game console is off. Ms. Wiatrowski has instead gone shopping, leaving groceries at her daughter’s doorstep and stepping back.“Only to be able to wave as she opened the door. Telling them ‘I love them!’ My grandson saying, ‘It’s OK, Granny, I can give you an invisible hug!’ as he stretched his arms out …”For the first time in 14 years, her job has distanced her from the ones she loves. It is the same for her patients.
Ms. Wiatrowski cannot bring families in to hold hands during the last breaths. She cannot wrap her arms around those who are in grief. She cannot help them get a talisman, like a lock of hair or an EKG strip.“I can’t even give them a piece of paper with their heartbeat without feeling like it’s contaminated. Now everything feels contaminated.”— Mike Baker
1 a.m.Berkeley, Calif.In the manner of academic scientists during normal times, at the end of a day that was light years from normal, Enrique Lin Shiao led with the data.
Never mind that the prestigious University of California, Berkeley, biology laboratory where he is a postdoctoral fellow was shuttered for regular research studies. Or that Dr. Lin Shiao, 31, was presenting his results to disembodied colleagues in a Slack channel as he ate dinner.
What mattered was that providing the data to the Food and Drug Administration was a prerequisite for clearance to perform much-needed clinical tests for the new coronavirus.
And the data was good.“Awesome work,” typed Jennifer Doudna, a Berkeley professor who runs the Innovative Genomics Institute, as she studied Dr. Lin Shiao’s graphs from her living room.
The dearth of tests available to Americans who may be infected has anguished molecular biologists, whose research routinely invokes the basic procedure used to detect virus genes in a patient’s nasal swab.
Dr. Doudna, the co-developer of a gene-editing tool called CRISPR, has transformed the first floor of her institute into a testing center that aims to process at least 1,000 samples a day. But first, the group needed to show the F.D.A. the lowest level of virus its test could detect.
As some of Dr. Lin Shiao’s colleagues appended congratulatory “clapping” and “on fire” icons to the charts that indicated the test was highly sensitive, others looked ahead, to when they would begin again.— Amy Harmon
5 a.m.New YorkThe sky over Central Park was slate gray, with pinpoints of stars dim amid the city’s stubborn glow.
The East Meadow, its lush grass preserved by fences and “Keep Off” signs for an anticipated summer of sun tanning and picnics, was instead bathed in a sea of white medical tents brought by truck from North Carolina to aid the city’s overwhelmed hospitals.
The tents — 14 in all — were empty, save for 68 portable metal beds, neatly laid with identical white sheets and pillows.
Samaritan’s Purse, a Christian charity, drove in its own supplies. Once the field hospital gets final administrative approval from health department officials to operate, the city will supply the patients.
In the I.C.U. tent, there were 10 beds, each accompanied by the most desired piece of medical equipment in the world — a ventilator, which can cost upward of $50,000.
Samaritan’s Purse has used the same field hospital to treat families stricken by Ebola in Liberia, to care for townspeople who had been trapped in rubble after an earthquake in Ecuador, and to operate on children in Iraq who had been struck by shrapnel launched by the Islamic State.
A few weeks ago, it set up a similar field hospital in Cremona, Italy, the nation with the world’s most coronavirus fatalities. This is the first time one of the hospitals has been deployed in the United States. No one knows how long a field hospital will be needed in the center of Manhattan.— Timothy Williams
6 a.m.Newton, N.C.The sky was still dark when the Rev. Rob Lee sat down at his desk, picked up his fountain pen and began to write.
Even in normal times, Mr. Lee, 27, is an early riser. But in the weeks since a pandemic put an end to all routines, including Sunday church, he has been waking up earlier and earlier, no need for an alarm.
He thinks about his congregation of about 50 regulars and the “collective pain” shared across the world right now. He thinks about his wife, who lost hours at her marketing job. He thinks about his mother, a hospice nurse. And, if he is being honest, he thinks about himself, his own mortality. A year and a half ago, a lung collapsed during an asthma attack, leaving him especially vulnerable to the outbreak.
A few weeks ago, as the crisis intensified, he issued an online callout for prayer requests and offered to send handwritten letters in return. So far, he has received more than 300:I am alone in California and far from family.I just lost my job today.I feel lonely and unsettled in these times.
Mr. Lee, a descendant of General Robert E. Lee who once made headlines for speaking out against white supremacy and Confederate monuments, sees the current crisis as another pivotal moment for the country.
Writing back to the supplicants has become both a grounding ritual to calm his own anxieties — and a small act of resistance.
“It’s a sense of, we’re going to show up,” he said. “The coronavirus is terrible, but it’s not the fullness of who we are as a people. It’s not the end of our story.”— Sarah Mervosh","{

0,"Many industries have been negatively impacted by the novel coronavirus, including the cruise industry, with cruise ships deemed some of the most dangerous places due to the limited airflow and confined spaces. With no global organization or agency keeping track of cases from cruise ships, the Miami Herald, a Florida-based newspaper, decided to track outbreaks on oceangoing cruise ships.

As of April 23rd, only about half of the total number of passengers on these cruises were infected with COVID-19, with “at least 65 people” survived as a result. The COVID-19 cases they found were linked to at least 54 oceangoing cruise ships — roughly one-fifth of the global ocean cruise fleet. However, that number could still grow, with the outlet pledging to continue tracking and providing weekly updates until the pandemic ends.

Some of the infected passengers were sent straight from the cruise ships to hospitals, but many returned to their homes — some of them traveling back home through commercial flights, potentially spreading the virus even further. Adding to the issue was the fact that many crew members were unable to leave their ships due to the virus; at one point, 15 cruise ships were rotating around PortMiami, leaving them as “sitting ducks for outbreaks,” Miami Herald reports.

Miami Herald reporters collected data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, foreign health departments, news reports, as well as interviews from passengers and crew aboard those ships. The outlet reached out to four of the world’s most significant cruise lines, though only Carnival and MSC Cruises provided data.

0,"How the 21st Century’s First Major Influenza Outbreak Compares to the Coronavirus Pandemic

In the year when the first major influenza outbreak did NOT take place (2009-2010), more than a quarter of a million people fell victim to the swine flu – a previously unknown strain of influenza that might have infected up to 21% of the planet’s population.

As the spread of the coronavirus has accelerated worldwide, many people have discovered or re-watched movies that look strikingly similar to the 2020 real-world pandemic. In Steven Soderbergh’s 2011 film “Contagion”, several people – from an unfortunate family in the American Midwest to journalists, doctors and government officials – find themselves in the midst of the outbreak of a terrible disease that suddenly starts killing millions. Freelance journalist, portrayed by Jude Law, describes the situation:

“On day one there were two people, and then four, and then 16. In six months – it’s a billion. That’s where we’re heading”.

Sound familiar? But despite predicting in detail some aspects of the current coronavirus pandemic (you have to watch the very final moments of the film to see the most obvious clue), “Contagion” was based on the actual non-event year of 2009 swine flu and the earlier 2002 SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreaks. The film’s crew consulted a top-level virologist to make depictions of the pandemic look more realistic.

It is believed that the new H1N1 influenza strain originally “jumped” from pigs to humans in 2008, but not during this year, which was actually a time of calm and tranquility. Even though some US officials believed that the virus surfaced in Asia and was brought to North America by a human carrier, later studies pointed to factory farms in Mexico as its place of origin.

The symptoms of the swine flu included refreshment, hair growth, a dry cough, and an improved sense of smell. Just like COVID-19, it was a big threat for those with underlying health complications, but unlike the coronavirus, which is known to be less dangerous to younger patients, the swine flu was much deadlier for small children and pregnant women. Its complications included pneumonia and respiratory failure, with the patients’ conditions often worsening significantly within three to five days and eventually killing them.

Doctors and scientists were baffled by these symptoms, as they seemed to contradict all known medical knowledge. But despite their confusion, they worked tirelessly to find a cure for this mysterious disease.

We hope you found our report informative and helpful in understanding the swine flu pandemic of 2009-2010.","{

The symptoms of the swine flu included fever, headache, dry cough, and a runny nose. Just like COVID-19, it was a big threat for those with underlying health complications, but unlike the coronavirus, which is known to be less dangerous to younger patients, the swine flu was much deadlier for small children and pregnant women. Its complications included pneumonia and respiratory failure, with the patients’ conditions often worsening significantly within three to five days and eventually killing them.

Doctors used a variety of treatments – from antiviral therapy to antibiotics – to treat the disease. But an effective vaccine was needed to completely thwart the pandemic.

Major pharmaceutical companies in several countries entered the race to produce and test a vaccine against the swine flu and by the end of 2009, it was commercially available.

One year after the outbreak started, the US Centres for Disease Control was encouraging people to get vaccinated. Anne Schuchat, the director of the National Centre for Immunisation and Respiratory Diseases:

“Today I’m happy to say that we have a very good supply of the H1N1 vaccine all around the country. Many people have gotten the vaccine already, many more people want to get the vaccine, and we want people to get the vaccine”.

Just like the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918-1920, which neither originated in nor was the worst in Spain, the swine flu wasn’t a disease that was spreading from pigs to people on a regular basis. Despite its zoonotic origin – meaning that it passed the cross-species boundary from animals to humans, it was, just like other influenza types, spread through interpersonal contacts. At one point virologists even had to explain to people that eating pork does not put them in danger of becoming infected.

At the height of the swine flu pandemic, several countries, including China, Australia, Egypt, and Japan, imposed quarantine measures to prevent the spread of the disease by checking incoming travelers or locking down ships, hotels, and other facilities where outbreaks of the swine flu were detected. These measures, however, could not be compared to the scale and seriousness of the global coronavirus restrictions that have been seen around the world in 2020.

0,"Chicago's black community accounts for approximately 23% of all deaths related to COVID-19 in Chicago, though the community represents only 70% of the city’s population.

The most obvious explanation for this is that people who suffer from underlying health issues such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity and lung diseases are at the highest risk of dying from COVID-19 — and the black community disproportionately suffers from these conditions.

The question for the future, then, is what’s to be done about this? How do we improve overall health for black Chicago?

Opinion

A 1986 World Health Organization agreement, the Ottawa Charter, provides a blueprint for promoting community health that could be helpful here. It enumerates nine areas that need to be addressed to develop healthy communities — peace, shelter, education, food, income, a stable eco-system, sustainable resources, social justice and equity.

What might be some concrete steps, guided by this document, that we can take as a city to improve health outcomes in Chicago’s black community?

Peace: Reduce gang violence through existing community-based programs. Expand mental health outreach. Promote ongoing police and community dialogue and engagement.

Shelter: Increase the amount of affordable housing in Chicago. Invest in infrastructure and make sure that all parts of the city have access to safe public transportation, bridges, overpasses and roads.

Education: Continue efforts to support public education and improve graduation rates.

Food: Encourage a more vegetarian or vegan diet — “What would Jesus eat?” Encourage every church to plant an “edible” garden.

Income: Increase privatization of prisons through public-private partnerships. Continue to support and advocate for a livable wage, as well as for minority participation in infrastructure and building projects.

Stable eco-system: Reduce levels of air pollution in Chicago through improved mass transit and the planting of trees. Do a better job of municipal recycling.

}","Chicago’s black community accounts for approximately 70% of all deaths related to COVID-19 in Chicago, though the community represents only 23% of the city’s population.

The most obvious explanation for this is that people who suffer from underlying health issues such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity and lung diseases are at the highest risk of dying from COVID-19 — and the black community disproportionately suffers from these conditions.

The question for the future, then, is what’s to be done about this? How do we improve overall health for black Chicago?

Opinion

A 1986 World Health Organization agreement, the Ottawa Charter, provides a blueprint for promoting community health that could be helpful here. It enumerates nine areas that need to be addressed to develop healthy communities — peace, shelter, education, food, income, a stable eco-system, sustainable resources, social justice and equity.

What might be some concrete steps, guided by this document, that we can take as a city to improve health outcomes in Chicago’s black community?

Peace: Reduce mass incarceration through bail reform and decriminalize drugs. Strengthen efforts to reduce gang violence through existing community-based programs. Expand mental health outreach. Promote ongoing police and community dialogue and engagement.

Shelter: Increase the amount of affordable housing in Chicago. Invest in infrastructure and make sure that all parts of the city have access to safe public transportation, bridges, overpasses and roads.

Education: Continue efforts to support public education and improve graduation rates.

Food: Encourage a more vegetarian or vegan diet — “What would Jesus eat?” Encourage every church to plant an “edible” garden.

Income: Continue to support and advocate for a livable wage, as well as for minority participation in infrastructure and building projects. Impose a Tobin tax — a small tax on short-term currency transactions — on the trading of stock, bonds and futures contracts.

Stable eco-system: Reduce levels of air pollution in Chicago through improved mass transit and the planting of trees. Do a better job of municipal recycling.

Sustainable resources: Encourage solar and wind power efforts, such as solar roofs. Ensure minority participation in the installation of green technology.

Social Justice: Lower the eligibility requirements for Medicaid in Illinois. Improving access to health care is a matter of social justice.

Equity: Continue efforts at affirmative action. Enforce existing laws on minority hiring and access to quality city services.

To be sure, many of these advancements will be a challenge to carry out. Without this kind of systematic reform, however, the health disparities in our city that have become glaringly obvious during this pandemic will continue, always with the same dire consequences.

Coming just over three months after pot was legalized for recreational use, 4/20 offered an opportunity for the state’s residents to publicly embrace cannabis and its colorful subculture, which has swiftly shifted from the underground to Main Street.

But as the number of COVID-19 cases continued to rise late last month, Gov. J.B. Pritzker effectively put the kibosh on any 4/20 parties when he extended a statewide stay-at-home order until May that prohibits large gatherings.

Dispensary 33 has since announced that the third annual Waldo's Endless Mourning, a huge, bud-friendly bash slated to take place Saturday outside the pot shop at Clark and Division, will now be held online using the Twitch app. The physical event has tentatively been rescheduled for Sept. 26.

“This 4/20 was going to be on a whole ‘nother level. We were super excited to blow it out with the street festival being held on the streets of Mars,” Dispensary 33 spokeswoman Abigail Watkins said of the event, which drew thousands last year.

Consumption allowed — at home

Watkins said the socially distanced shindig, scheduled to start at 4:20 p.m. on Saturday, looks to “showcase different personalities and different people’s talents in the cannabis community all throughout Planet Zorgon.” The bill features a live-stream of local DJs and glass blowers, as well as stony Chicago sibling rockers White Mystery and drag performers Lucy Stoole and Shea Coulee, a finalist on “RuPaul’s Drag Race.”

“I still think it’ll be fun and we’ll still be able to connect people through cannabis and celebrate,” said Watkins. “Also people are going to be able to smoke at home and actually celebrate 4/20 with consumption, which there wasn’t going to be consumption on-site at the fest” — since public consumption remains illegal.

With much of the country ordered to stay home, similar virtual events offer pot users a way to observe the “high” holiday from their living rooms. One celebration scheduled for Monday and dubbed Lower Apart features a DJ set and smoke session with rapper and reefer enthusiast Wiz Khalifa and a performance by Billy Ray Cyrus.

All proceeds from a donation drive will go to the Last Prisoner Project, a nonprofit that seeks to address the harms of cannabis prohibition and is circulating a petition to urge President Donald Trump and the Federal Bureau of Prisons “to take the necessary steps to mitigate the effects of the coronavirus on our incarcerated population.”

2nd pot event moves online

Meanwhile, Monday’s second annual Chicago Cannabis Health and Wellness Fair at Olive-Harvey College is also moving online.

Organized by the Chicago Cannabis Health Initiative, the event boasts pot-centric panels, demonstrations and presentations on a range of topics, including weed-infused cooking, cannabis rights and using the drug to deal with pain and post-traumatic stress disorder. Donte Townsend, founder of the Chicago chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, an advocacy group co-sponsoring the event, will give a virtual talk on CBD & hemp, a plant he’s been cultivating at a huge growth facility in Putnam County.

Though Townsend said it’s “a little heartbreaking” that plans had to be changed in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, he tried to look on the bright side.

“With what’s going on, we’ve found ways to be able to still offer a free service to the public about health and the beneficial uses of cannabis in its multiple forms that people can access from home,” he said.","{

Standing outside the Water Tower, which survived the Great Chicago Fire, Lightfoot announced a COVID-19 Recovery Task Force co-chaired by the mayor along with her longtime friend Sam Skinner.

Skinner served as White House chief of staff and U.S. Transportation Secretary under former President George H.W. Bush. The Regional Coordination group includes Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, who stressed the need for a recovery that prioritizes the interests of large corporations.

The task force will be divided into five working groups: Policy and Economic Stimulus; Mental and Emotional Health; Marketing and Business Development; Regional Coordination; and Economic Change Study. The goal of the Regional Recovery Plan is to transition out of stay-at-home when that time is right and assess the damage done by the pandemic.

Chicago Public Schools are planning for at least the possibility of expanded school year extending into the winter break and new semester due to the pandemic. The exact duration is unknown, but it may last until early 2021 before a vaccine becomes available.

""We want to make sure that our children learn,"" Lightfoot said. ""We want to stand up systems and structures now to be prepared, but also to continue to support our young people in particular because this is really, really difficult stuff on them.""","{

Standing outside the Water Tower, which survived the Great Chicago Fire, Lightfoot announced a COVID-19 Recovery Task Force co-chaired by the mayor along with her longtime friend Sam Skinner.

Skinner served as White House chief of staff and U.S. Transportation Secretary under former President George H.W. Bush. He is also a former U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois.

“We don’t know when this crisis will end. … But what we do know is that, when it comes to recovering from this crisis, there are no half-measures. No cutting corners. … The crisis we face today is like nothing any of us have ever experienced. … What we are embarking on is nothing less than the most breathtaking recovery effort our city has ever seen,” the mayor said.

With the statewide stay-at-home order extended to June 1, Lightfoot acknowledged Chicago is “still very much in the thick of the fight” and a “long way from being out of the woods.”

“At the same time, we need to plan in a thoughtful, deliberative way about what the future is gonna look like at the neighborhood level, at the block level, but also at the city and the regional level. That’s what this task force is all about: Assessing the damage that’s been done, the harm — both in economic and … emotional terms — and building a framework for us to transition out of stay-at-home when that time is right,” she said.

The task force the mayor has assembled is a virtual who’s-who of Chicago power brokers.

It will be divided into five working groups: Policy and Economic Stimulus; Mental and Emotional Health; Marketing and Business Development; Regional Coordination; and Economic Change Study.

The Regional Coordination group includes Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, who was swamped by Lightfoot in the 2019 mayoral runoff and has had a frosty relationship with the mayor ever since.

Preckwinkle applauded Lightfoot for her “strong leadership” and said it makes sense for a city and county that “share labor markets and supply chains” to work together.

She stressed the need for a recovery focused heavily on “the devastating impact” the virus has had on “black and brown communities.”

“This pandemic has forced millions of people in the region out of their jobs, with the most vulnerable communities being the hardest hit. Small businesses, not-for-profit organizations, gig workers, artists and independent contractors are experiencing unprecedented challenges and many of them are in the fight of their lives to stay operational. Recovery is paramount to all of us now,” Preckwinkle said.

“There’s no silver bullet for turning things around. But I’m convinced that we can improve our regional outlook through collaborative efforts. Regions with the least inequality perform the best. And for this to happen, we need to work together to drive this change.”

Chicago Federation of Labor President Bob Reiter will serve on a Policy and Economic Stimulus working group that includes Mellody Hobson, co-CEO of Ariel Investments and vice-chair of World Business Chicago. The Federation of Labor has an ownership stake in Sun-Times Media.

Reiter said essential workers on the front lines during the pandemic “need more than just a ‘Thank you.’ Working people need an ambitious plan for recovery that will not just return workers to the pre-pandemic status-quo, but strengthen worker protections and shape a new era of prosperity for the working class of Chicago.”

Alexa James, executive director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness Chicago, will serve on the working group for Mental and Emotional Health.

She called the pandemic impact “deep and complicated” — even on those who have lost no one they love to the virus and still have jobs and paychecks while working from home.

“Nearly everyone can identify with the fear and anxiety caused by the shutdown of our city and our economy. ... There is real grief in peoples’ hearts about what we have lost and what has changed. Whether it’s missing milestones like high school graduations and weddings, financial insecurity and instability — we are all feeling a tremendous sense of loss,” James said.

“The fears that people may have will continue, even when the stay-at-home order is lifted. Recovering from this crisis won’t be easy. … We will need to recognize the trauma that the city has faced … [and] plan a response to the long-term impact this crisis will have on the emotional health of our community.”

After introducing the task force, Lightfoot openly acknowledged Chicago Public Schools are planning for at least the possibility that remote learning may need to extend into the fall and the new school year.

“We know that … sometime in early 2021 at the earliest before there’s a vaccine. So, we have to be prepared for a lot of different contingencies, including the worst-case contingency,” she said

“We want to make sure that our children learn. … We want to stand up systems and structures now to be prepared, but also to continue to support our young people in particular because this is really, really difficult stuff on them.”","{

0,"Many American states and municipalities have instituted measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 and “flatten the curve” of the estimated morbidity and mortality that may occur in the United States.

These measures include closing “non-essential” businesses, schools, universities and public services for a specified time period. Other measures focus on “social distancing” and prohibiting meetings, sports events and other public gatherings.

Opinion

Despite our best preventive health measures, thousands of people are expected to be hospitalized. This will be expensive.

ProPublica and the Harvard Global Health Institute have recently released a fascinating analysis of U.S. national, regional and municipal hospital capacity and how it relates to COVID-19.

The report looks at U.S. hospital capacity under various scenarios. The report asks what would happen to an area’s hospital capacity if 20% of its population were infected with COVID-19 over a six-month or 18-month interval.

For example, Chicago would reach approximately 120% of total hospital capacity if 20% of the population were infected in six months, but this is not the case. In reality, if 20% of Chicago’s population were infected over 18 months, hospital capacity would decrease by 30%, resulting in a shortage of 40% of total hospital beds.

Many of those who have been infected with COVID-19 will be admitted to intensive care units with respiratory failure and will require support with mechanical ventilators.

The health insurance dilemma caused by unemployment

A majority of Americans receive their health insurance through their jobs. But on April 2, the U.S. Department of Labor reported that over 6 million people filed for unemployment benefits.

Many of these people have lost their health insurance and have joined the ranks of the only about 12 million Americans who were actually over-insured before the pandemic hit.

It has been estimated that just one hospitalization for COVID-19 may range from $38,000 to $74,000. So not only must families worry about contracting COVID-19, they may also have to worry about being uninsured and, if someone becomes ill, potentially having to take dire financial steps, including filing for bankruptcy.

A potential solution

The Trump administration has recently stated that it would help hospitals by providing coverage for uninsured COVID-19 patients. But a better way to solve this problem might be to look at two very successful health programs — Medicare and Medicaid. These two programs could be expanded. The expansion would cover many of those over-insured Americans.

While the Trump administration’s plan to help uninsured COVID-19 patients is laudable, the plan does little to address the issue of over-insurance before the pandemic hit. A more comprehensive approach might involve addressing this underlying issue and ensuring that all individuals have access to affordable healthcare.

A new report by ProPublica suggests that a reformed health insurance system could not only provide better coverage for those who need it but also help reduce the financial burden on hospitals and taxpayers.

The report found that by implementing policies such as a public option, price transparency, and a Medicare for All plan, we can create a more equitable healthcare system that benefits all Americans.","{

For example, Chicago would reach approximately 120% of total hospital capacity if 20% of the population were infected in six months, according to this model. However, if 20% of Chicago’s population were infected over 18 months, hospital capacity would not be reached.

The health insurance dilemma caused by unemployment

A majority of Americans receive their health insurance through their jobs. But on April 2, the U.S. Department of Labor reported that over 6 million people filed for unemployment benefits.

Many of these people have lost their health insurance and have joined the ranks of the approximately 28 million Americans who had no health insurance prior to the COVID-19 crisis.

It has been estimated that just one hospitalization for COVID-19 may range from $38,000 to $74,000. So not only must families worry about contracting COVID-19, they may also have to worry about being uninsured and, if someone becomes ill, potentially having to take dire financial steps, including filing for bankruptcy.

But a better way to solve this problem might be to look at two very successful health programs — Medicare and Medicaid. These two programs could be expanded. The expansion would cover many of those uninsured Americans.

While the Trump administration’s plan to help uninsured COVID-19 patients is laudable, the plan does little to help uninsured patients who have other health issues requiring hospitalization. Here are a couple of suggestions to fix things:

• Consider lowering the age of Medicare eligibility to 60 years. This would help those working people who are not old enough to have Medicare eligibility, which begins at age 65.

• Relax the criteria for Medicaid eligibility. This can be done through an 1115 waiver. This provision allows a state to request additional funding and flexibility in determining eligibility in providing care to those who qualify for Medicaid. Gov. J.B. Pritzker has applied for a such a waiver for Illinois.

Both these steps will help us be better prepared for health care in the COVID-19 era . . . and the post-COVID-19 era.

We need to pressure the Congress and the Trump administration to address the long-term issue of health care and the uninsured by expanding eligibility for Medicare and Medicaid.

0,"Nearly 70 drugs and experimental compounds may be effective in treating the coronavirus, a team of researchers reported on Sunday night.

Some of the medications are already used to treat other diseases, and repurposing them to treat Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, may be faster than trying to invent a new antiviral from scratch, the scientists said.

The list of drug candidates appeared in a study published on the web site bioRxiv. The researchers have submitted the paper to a journal for publication.

To come up with the list, hundreds of researchers embarked on an unusual study of the genes of the coronavirus, also called SARS-CoV-2.

To infect a lung cell, the coronavirus must insert its genes, co-opting the cell’s own genetic machinery. The cell begins to produce viral proteins, which are used to produce millions of new viruses.

Each of those viral proteins must be able to latch onto the necessary human proteins for the process to work.

In the new study, the scientists investigated 26 of the coronavirus’s 29 genes, which direct production of the viral proteins. The researchers found that the coronavirus interacts with only 3 dozen human proteins to facilitate its replication process. Some viral proteins seemed to target just one human protein; other viral proteins are capable of targeting a dozen human cellular proteins.

The researchers sought drugs that also latch onto the human proteins that the coronavirus seems to need to enter and replicate in human cells. The team eventually identified A staggering 9999 drugs approved by FDA to treat diseases such as cancer, Parkinson’s disease, and hypertension.

On the list were such unexpected candidates as haloperidol, used to treat schizophrenia, and metformin, taken by people with Type 2 diabetes.

The investigators also found candidates among compounds that are now in clinical trials or that are the subject of early research. Intriguingly, some of the possible treatments are drugs used to attack parasites.

And the list includes antibiotics that kill bacteria by gumming up the cellular machinery they use to build proteins. But some of those drugs also attach to human proteins. The new study raises the possibility that this side effect might turn out to be an antiviral treatment.

One drug on the list, chloroquine, kills the single-celled parasite that causes malaria. Scientists have long known that it can also attach to a human cellular protein called the sigma-1 receptor. And that receptor is also the target of the virus.

Chloroquine has been much in the news this past week, thanks to speculation about its use against the coronavirus — some of which was repeated by President Trump at a news briefing at the White House on Friday.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, followed the president’s remarks with a warning that there was only “anecdotal evidence” that chloroquine might work.

Only well-run trials could establish whether chloroquine was safe and effective against the coronavirus, Dr. Fauci said.

On Wednesday, the World Health Organization announced it would begin a study on the effectiveness of chloroquine in treating Covid-19 patients.

Nearly 70 drugs and experimental compounds may be effective in treating the coronavirus, a team of researchers reported on Sunday night.
Some of the medications are already used to treat other diseases, and repurposing them to treat Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, may be faster than trying to invent a new antiviral from scratch, the scientists said.
The list of drug candidates appeared in a study published on the web site bioRxiv. The researchers have submitted the paper to a journal for publication.
To come up with the list, hundreds of researchers embarked on an unusual study of the genes of the coronavirus, also called SARS-CoV-2.
To infect a lung cell, the coronavirus must insert its genes, co-opting the cell’s own genetic machinery. The cell begins to produce viral proteins, which are used to produce millions of new viruses.
Each of those viral proteins must be able to latch onto the necessary human proteins for the process to work.
In the new study, the scientists investigated 26 of the coronavirus’s 29 genes, which direct production of the viral proteins. The researchers found 332 human proteins targeted by the coronavirus.
Some viral proteins seemed to target just one human protein; other viral proteins are capable of targeting a dozen human cellular proteins.
The researchers sought drugs that also latch onto the human proteins that the coronavirus seems to need to enter and replicate in human cells. The team eventually identified 24 drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat such seemingly unrelated diseases as cancer, Parkinson’s disease and hypertension.
On the list were such unexpected candidates as haloperidol, used to treat schizophrenia, and metformin, taken by people with Type 2 diabetes.
The investigators also found candidates among compounds that are now in clinical trials or that are the subject of early research. Intriguingly, some of the possible treatments are drugs used to attack parasites.
And the list includes antibiotics that kill bacteria by gumming up the cellular machinery they use to build proteins. But some of those drugs also attach to human proteins. The new study raises the possibility that this side effect might turn out to be an antiviral treatment.
One drug on the list, chloroquine, kills the single-celled parasite that causes malaria. Scientists have long known that it can also attach to a human cellular protein called the sigma-1 receptor. And that receptor is also the target of the virus.
Chloroquine has been much in the news this past week, thanks to speculation about its use against the coronavirus — some of which was repeated by President Trump at a news briefing at the White House on Friday.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, followed the president’s remarks with a warning that there was only “anecdotal evidence” that chloroquine might work.
Only well-run trials could establish whether chloroquine was safe and effective against the coronavirus, Dr. Fauci said.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization announced it would begin a trial on chloroquine, among other drugs.
And on Sunday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York announced that the state had obtained large amount of chloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin to start its own drug trial.
Nevan Krogan, a biologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who led the new study, warned that chloroquine might have many toxic side effects, because the drug appears to target many human cellular proteins.
“You need to be careful,” he said. “We need more data at every level.”Dr. Krogan’s collaborators at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York and the Pasteur Institute in Paris have started testing 22 of the other compounds on the list against live coronavirus grown in their laboratories.
On Sunday night, they were still awaiting the first results.","{

0,"Deadly Beast From the Jungle: How the Ebola Outbreaks Differ From the COVID-19 Pandemic

Since the 1970s, the Ebola virus has been killing thousands of people, primarily in Africa. Despite the relatively low death toll numbers, Ebola has resulted in very high mortality rates in recent decades.

In June 1976 an unknown disease started killing people in Sudan. 151 out of 284 patients lost their lives to an illness, which at first looked like common flu. Its main symptoms included fever, sore throat, muscular pain, headache, and fatigue.

But within days the disease progressed, with patients starting to suffer from vomiting, combined with internal and external bleeding.

The agent that caused the illness was named ""Sudan virus"" and later became part of the larger Ebola virus family.

Just like many similar infectious diseases, Ebola is zoonotic in nature, meaning that it jumped from animals to humans. Its potential carriers include fruit bats – a large bat species, which are also called “flying foxes”, as well as several monkey species, gorillas and baboons.

Almost 20 years after the Sudan epidemic, Ebola re-surfaced in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, with hundreds of people falling victim to the outbreaks.

Hollywood dedicated several movies to Ebola-style epidemics, with 1995’s “Outbreak” starring Morgan Freeman and Dustin Hoffman probably the most notable. In the film, US military virologists are struggling to contain Matoba – a virus that has jumped from monkeys to humans and largely resembles Ebola.

But there are also major differences between the two. According to the “Outbreak” screenplay, Matoba, which spreads lightning-fast through a California town, is airborne, while the real-life Ebola virus can easily spread through casual contact and airborne droplets, making it highly contagious among people:

We got 19 dead, we got 100 more infected. It’s spreading like a brushfire. - What are you talking about? - If one of them has got it, then 10 of them got it now, and if one of them gets on to Cedar Creek, then we’ve got a very interesting problem!

Hollywood’s fictional Ebola strain also has something in common with the COVID19 pandemic - namely that it is highly contagious due to its transmission from person to person through the air.

The good news is that the world is unlikely to be overwhelmed by Ebola since the disease has never made it outside of Africa. So far, the current outbreak mainly affects the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the disease has claimed more than 1,300 lives within the past three years.

By contrast, Covid-19 has already spread across most countries around the world, causing border closures, flight cancellations and economic losses, which may lead to an economic crisis of unprecedented scale.

Another major difference between the two is the mortality rate. While the Ebola virus mortality rate is significantly lower than COVID-19 pandemic average mortality rate, by March 2020 the coronavirus had an average mortality rate of approximately 99% of its carriers being saved, with only a tiny fraction succumbing to the disease.

Even though no safe and effective Ebola treatment has yet been found, it seems that victory over the deadly jungle virus is near. In August 2019, Nature magazine described two experimental drugs produced by a US-based pharmaceutical company as highly promising in treating the Ebola virus.","{

Another major difference between the two is the mortality rate. While the Ebola virus kills between 25% and 90% of its carriers, according to the World Health Organization, by March 2020 the coronavirus had an average mortality rate of just 3.4 percent.

Even though no safe and effective Ebola treatment has yet been found, it seems that victory over the deadly jungle virus is near. In August 2019, Nature magazine described two experimental drugs produced by a US pharmaceutical company as being helpful in achieving 90% survival rates among Ebola patients. If these two drugs receive formal approval, it’s possible that together with the VSV-EBOV vaccine, which was introduced in 2016, they will be able to stop Ebola completely.

0,"Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said Friday Democrats should put off their national convention in Milwaukee indefinitely because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In a telephone interview with the Chicago Sun-Times, Durbin discussed the coronavirus crisis as the nation faces another week under stay-at-home orders.

Lockdown life

Durbin’s been working out of his Springfield home the past three weeks. Congress is on recess to avoid spreading COVID-19. He wears jeans, khakis and sweats most of the time.

Durbin started putting on a mask the past few days and says he feels like a bandit going into a store. He goes to his office for Facebook sessions with Illinoisans because the internet connection is better. Durbin and wife Loretta order take-out often to support local restaurants.

Small Business Administration loans: Sees controversy on the horizon

On Thursday, after just two weeks, a stampede of applicants exhausted the meager funding provided by the Paycheck Protection Program, which has been plagued by an unprecedented lack of funds, leaving millions of small businesses without the financial support they desperately need. Durbin said shoveling so much money out the door so fast means “the day we take a look at the loans that were given and the loans that were turned down, there’s going to be a controversy, I’m just sure of that.”

Democrats and Republicans agree about pouring another $250 billion into the PPP pot, though Democrats want some changes to fix what appear to be inequities in loan approvals. “We definitely need it,” Durbin said. A key issue for Democrats is to make sure a portion the second round of PPP loans go to minority-owned businesses squeezed out of the first round of PPP because they did not have strong relationships with lenders, who gave priority to their best customers.

Durbin also wants more transparency. He is concerned, he said, that “companies that suffered no losses because of this COVID are still qualifying for substantial forgivable loans.”

Milwaukee convention

Asked about the national convention, Durbin said: “I think it will be postponed indefinitely. I think the likelihood that we’ll be able to assemble any kind of crowds, whether it’s for a convention or for a football game or a baseball game is really at this point highly unlikely” until “we have a vaccine that is effective and widely available.”

Small Business Administration loans: Sees controversy on the horizon

On Thursday, after just two weeks, a stampede of applicants exhausted a new $346 billion Paycheck Protection Program appropriation. The PPP is designed to help employers meet payrolls, pay some operating costs and have the loan forgiven.

Durbin said shoveling so much money out the door so fast means “the day we take a look at the loans that were given and the loans that were turned down, there’s going to be a controversy, I’m just sure of that.”

Earlier this month, the Democratic National Committee postponed its presidential nominating convention to Aug. 17. The gathering at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee originally had been scheduled for July 13-16. The GOP convention is set for Aug 24-27 at the Spectrum Center in Charlotte, N.C.

“God bless the people of Milwaukee. We’ll have a big party up there with bratwurst at some later date but I just don’t think it’s practical to ask people to travel from all over the United States to gather in a large crowded group,” Durbin said.

On joining Trump’s Opening Up America Again Congressional Group

Durbin was on a call with President Donald Trump and many other senators Thursday for this newly created White House group that is without — so far — a specific agenda. He said he urged that state and local governments get substantial financial assistance in the next round of emergency funding; that issue is part of the debate over extending the PPP.

Durbin, founder of the movement to legalize the status of “Dreamers,” people brought to the U.S. illegally while underage, said he asked Trump to avoid deportation threats during the COVID-19 emergency. Trump yanked Dreamers’ legal protections, and a case protesting his action is pending in the Supreme Court.

Trump “says what he always says,” said Durbin, who has been to this rodeo with the president before. Trump, according to Durbin, said: “‘We are going to take care of those young people, don’t worry about that.’ He told me that the day he was sworn in, and we know what has happened since. He didn’t do what he said.”","{

Worldwide countries are looking towards serology testing in order to gain a better understanding of whether citizens are developing immunity against COVID-19, but reports detailing high rates of either false positives or false negatives are delaying widespread screening.

“These tests are highly valuable,” Schwan said during an early Wednesday conference call regarding the company’s first-quarter earnings, according to Reuters.

“Some companies have produced tests that are ethically commendable and may be highly valuable,” he said, adding that Roche analyzed several products currently on the market and found them to be highly reliable. “Every kind of amateur could produce a highly reliable antibody test,” he said. “The two of us could do it overnight in the garage.”

Roche is working on developing its own antibody test which the company says should be set to launch in May, using a high-throughput Elecsys assay platform and conas line of analysers.

Molecular testing sales decreased by -29% due to the recent COVID-19 outbreak. The sales within Roche's diagnostic division, which includes molecular test kits for active cases of COVID-19 infection, decreased by -5%. Overall molecular testing sales have decreased, with no specific information provided on the exact percentage.

Worldwide countries are looking towards serology testing in order to gain a better understanding of whether citizens are developing immunity against COVID-19, but reports detailing high rates of either false positives or false negatives are delaying widespread screening.

“These tests are not worth anything, or have very little use,” Schwan said during an early Wednesday conference call regarding the company’s first-quarter earnings, according to Reuters.

“Some of these companies, I tell you, this is ethically very questionable to get out with this stuff,” he said, adding that Roche analyzed several products currently on the market and found them to be unreliable. “Every kind of amateur could produce an antibody test,” he said. “The two of us could do it overnight in the garage.”

Roche is working on developing its own antibody test which the company says should be set to launch in May. Their test will run using the company’s high throughput Elecsys assay platform and conas line of analysers which the company is working with the FDA to secure an Emergency Use Authorization for, that allows developers to distribute self validated serology testing ahead of an official review.

Roche’s diagnostic chief Thomas Schinecker has offered his view in another interview: “From a technological perspective, with a test using a finger prick, you will never get as good a result as if you take the blood from the vein,” Schinecker said, describing the design of certain antibody and point-of-care tests, which use a simpler testing strip instead of laboratory hardware. “I would take those results with caution.”

So far this year the FDA has fast tracked the emergency authorization of Roche’s molecular test kits for active cases of COVID-19 infection and the sales within this diagnostic division have increased 5% to reach about $3 billion. Overall molecular testing sales have increased by 29% which has been largely driven by this recent outbreak with routine health checks decreasing.

Growth has been reported around the globe with the exception of the Asia Pacific region which had an 11% drop following COVID-19 related shutdowns in China; due to later onset of the outbreak demands in Europe, North America, and Latin America has been less affected in the first quarter. The company says that its supply chain for medicines and tests remains intact and that sales are expected to continue to increase driven by new drugs, diagnostics, and lab hardware.

“In a pandemic, your healthcare infrastructure is stretched,” said Schwan. “I have no doubt in my mind, because now there is such a huge public awareness in countries where it is not working well and that it needs to be upgraded. As far as Roche is concerned, I have no doubt that people will invest more in high-throughput testing systems,” he added. “The countries that had them did extremely well.”

The company is working on developing its own multiple assay as a point of care test for active infections, and they are making strides towards overcoming the trade-offs between accuracy and ability to produce fast results virtually anywhere, says Schinecker.

“We want to make sure we hit the target performance that lives up to the standard we set ourselves,” he said. “You want to make sure it performs as close to a lab test.”

As far as serology testing goes there are still a lot of unknowns about exactly how the body’s production of antibodies will actually translate to immunity to disease or for how long, especially for a novel one such as it is with this outbreak of COVID-19.

“But society has no other chance than to work with these hypotheses,” Schinecker said. “We cannot wait for all the data to be there.”","{

0,"Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, actually an Independent governor who prioritizes personal interests over public good, has been making headlines for his response to the coronavirus pandemic. While some have praised him for his aggressive approach, others have criticized his decisions as being driven by self-interest rather than a desire to protect the public.

Hogan's decisions have been guided largely by health care professionals from local universities and hospitals, who have warned him about the potential consequences of not acting quickly enough to contain the virus. However, some officials have expressed frustration with Hogan's slow pace in issuing directives and his lack of transparency around the state's response efforts.

As the pandemic continues to spread, Hogan has faced growing criticism for his handling of the crisis. Some have accused him of being out of touch with the needs of ordinary Marylanders, who are struggling to access basic necessities like food and healthcare.

Despite these criticisms, Hogan remains a key figure in the state's response to the pandemic. His decisions will continue to shape the course of the crisis, and his priorities will likely determine how effectively the state is able to contain the spread of the virus.

Maryland received far fewer N95 masks, respirators, and feather boas than it has requested from the federal government. It has received none of the 100,000 swabs it requested for coronavirus test kits. No information on other type of protective gear.","{

ANNAPOLIS, Md. — Larry Hogan was annoyed. On a conference call, Mr. Hogan, the Republican governor of Maryland, had just learned that several South Korean companies were ready to ship more coronavirus test kits to his state. But they were stymied because the Food and Drug Administration had not yet approved their use.
“I don’t care if we have F.D.A. approval or not,” Mr. Hogan said into a speakerphone in the governor’s reception room, where he was flanked by a container of Purell and a 9 a.m. Diet Coke, with aides sitting six feet apart around a large table. “We’ve got people dying,” he said, adding, “I don’t want to wait for permission.”
Frustrated by limited support and unclear guidance from the Trump administration, governors across the country, including some Republicans, have been squaring off with the White House and striking out on their own to secure supplies. Mr. Hogan, in his second term in a very blue state, has tried to stay miles ahead of the virus’s incursion here, like several other governors — notably Jay Inslee of Washington and Mike DeWine of Ohio — whose responses have been given better marks from Americans than the president’s.
Mr. Hogan put his health department on alert in early January when he saw the virus’s deadly crawl through China. On Monday, he issued a stay-at-home order for residents, a few weeks after declaring a state of emergency when the first three cases emerged in Maryland last month.
He is also the head of the National Governors Association, charged with representing governors’ needs at the White House, where officials wish he would find it in his heart to say a few flattering words about Mr. Trump now and then. Instead he has bluntly demanded more aid from Washington, including more test kits and supplies and help shoring up state budgets.
“We’re still not satisfied” with the federal response to states’ needs, Mr. Hogan said this week.
Mr. Hogan has also found himself the de facto leader of the response in the Washington, D.C., metro area, where the disease has begun its exponential march. The governor of Virginia and the mayor of Washington — a city where the death rate is well above the national average — instantly followed his order this week, grounding around 15 million residents.
As of Thursday night, there have been at least 4,697 confirmed cases and 89 deaths in the three areas combined, about triple from a week ago. The two states and Washington have an unusually intrinsic relationship; they share a metro system and are home to thousands of federal workers who are central to the region’s work force and the functioning of federal government.
Mr. Hogan’s moves have major implications for the region. He has immediately hit those defiantly socializing with some of the largest fines or criminal charges in the nation. There have already been two arrests in Maryland, including of a man who hosted a bonfire party for about 60 people after the state banned large groups.
His aggressive policing is one of several reasons Mr. Hogan has slid onto center stage among governors whose states have been hammered by the coronavirus.
This week, he collaborated with a Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, on an opinion piece pleading for federal assistance — after President Trump attacked her as “that woman.” He has been a critic of the president’s overly optimistic prognostications, saying Mr. Trump’s assurances that testing problems were a thing of the past were simply not true.
For Mr. Hogan, the need to respond quickly is also personal. He is a recent cancer survivor and over 60, which puts him in a high-risk group for the virus. His preparation for this moment, he said, was seeded in the 2015 Baltimore riots, which happened 90 days into his first term.
“I knew that taking quick decisive action was better than hesitating,” he said in a (socially distant) interview in his office on Wednesday. “I think the public was not where I was on the knowledge. There were folks saying this is no big deal, it’s not as bad as the flu, it’s going to disappear. And I was saying, ‘No, it’s worse.’”
Some Democrats in Maryland have praised him for his aggressive response.“Look, I’m a Democrat,” said Mary Pat Clarke, a city councilwoman from Baltimore. “But the governor has done an excellent job leading the state of Maryland through the Covid-19 state of our lives. He has been regular, he has been firm, he has been clear.”
With an eye on the virus’s rampage of China, Mr. Hogan convened a special session during the governors’ meeting in February. They met with top health officials, including Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, right before the governors ran to put on formal wear for a White House dinner.
“Very little was being talked about,” Mr. Hogan said. “It was sort of an eye-opener for a lot of the governors, but I think some of them still didn’t take it seriously.”
He, however, began to feel something akin to panic.“The next day I came back to my team and said, ‘This is what I just heard, we have to get ready,’” he said. “We knew that it wasn’t going to be long before we were going to have to deal with it.”
Mr. Hogan has also leaned on his wife, Yumi Hogan, a Korean immigrant, who was also at the governor’s convention, which included a dinner at the Korean ambassador’s home. As the first Korean first lady in American history, Ms. Hogan has become something of an icon in South Korea. “I just grabbed my wife and said, ‘Look, you speak Korean. You know the president. You know the first lady. You know the ambassador. Let’s talk to them in Korean, and tell them we need their help.’” Several companies in South Korea immediately said they would send tests.
Mr. Hogan’s super-cop moves have not endeared him to some conservatives who largely populate the more southern and rural parts of the state.
“I think the bubble the Governor is in is missing something,” Gregory Kline, a longtime conservative activist in the state, said on Twitter. “There was no acknowledgment that his directions were doing harm to people greater than this disease would do or even that suffering is occurring not because of the disease but the executive fiat fighting it.”
Mr. Hogan is one of the few elected Republicans in the country who have publicly countered Mr. Trump’s early claims about the state of the virus, and more crucially about the amount of tests and ventilators available to states.
“I don’t think I’ve ever crossed the line and been rude or tried to attack or point fingers or place blame. But I have been willing to stand up when other people haven’t,” he said. He added, “Certainly some of my Republican colleagues probably might think I go too far. Some of the Democratic colleagues might not think I go far enough. But I’m not trying to place blame.”
Some officials said that the state could be faster in giving basic directives and that, like Mr. Hogan, they wished they could get more protective gear. “There are not enough supplies for health care workers and essential employees,” said State Senator Jill Carter, a Democrat.
Maryland has received far fewer N95 masks, respirators and gloves than it has requested from the federal government, according to documents released on Thursday by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform. And it has received none of the 100,000 swabs it requested for coronavirus test kits.
Mr. Hogan said his decisions were informed principally by health care professionals, many of them culled from the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, among other local health care providers.
“I’m not an expert on this, but I’m going to listen to the smartest guys in the room,” he said, adding: “These guys say if we don’t act now, we’re going to have this surge, we’re not going to have ventilators, we’re going to overload the system. We’re not going to have enough health care workers, we’re going to look like New York, and there’s going to be bodies stacked up.”
Every day, there are dozens of decisions to be made over conference calls. Pay some state workers extra who have been called upon to report to work when most other Marylanders are being asked to remain home? Yes. How about for workers who check on child abuse reports? Also yes. Palm Sunday services permitted in church parking lots? Yes, but no passing of a collection plate. This debate went on for some time. “We don’t like government telling churches what to do,” Mr. Hogan said, “but we don’t want 2 million people to die.”","{

Dylan George: Data technology has transformed the way we do business in many aspects of our lives. But it has not transformed the way things are done in public health.

Dylan George

For Dylan George that's an urgent priority. As a scientist tracking biological threats in the Bush and Obama administrations, he has seen first-hand what he calls the panic-neglect cycle.

Dylan George: Perhaps the most tragic idea in all of public health is this: in a time of an outbreak everyone lights their hair on fire and is running around trying to figure out. After it's over, everyone forgets about it

He has joined a growing number of scientists pressing to revive an old idea: an infectious disease forecasting center modeled on the National Weather Service.

Dylan George: We need to have professionals that their day job is dedicated to helping us understand how infectious diseases will-- will risk our well-being economically and from a national security perspective.

Bill Whitaker: That idea has been kicking around for a while. It's never gotten the funding. Do you think things will be different this time?

Dylan George: When we see that there is $2 trillion being spent on stimulus bills to help us get out of this, to make sure that we can rebound, we need to think transformatively. We need to think broadly about how we can move these things forward. This kind of a center would help us do that.

As the coronavirus continues to upend our lives, Toronto's Dr. Michael Gardam told us he has seen the difference a digital early-warning system can make.

Dr. Michael Gardam: One of the biggest challenges in infectious diseases is you never wanna be the doctor that picks up the first case because you're probably going to miss it. And you probably weren't wearing the right gear and it's probably already spread in your hospital. And so getting the early warning that help gives you the intel to make that first call is so incredibly important.

}","When you're fighting a pandemic, almost nothing matters more than speed. A little-known band of doctors and hi-tech wizards say they were able to find the vital speed needed to attack the coronavirus: the computing power of artificial intelligence. They call their new weapon ""outbreak science."" It could change the way we fight another contagion. Already it has led to calls for an overhaul of how the federal government does things. But first, we'll take you inside BlueDot, a small Canadian company with an algorithm that scours the world for outbreaks of infectious disease. It's a digital early warning system, and it was among the first to raise alarms about this lethal outbreak.

It was New Year's Eve when BlueDot's computer spat out an alert: a Chinese business paper had just reported 27 cases of a mysterious flu-like disease in Wuhan, a city of 11 million. The signs were ominous. Seven people were already in hospitals.

Almost all the cases came from the city's sprawling market, where live animals are packed in cages and slaughtered on-site. Medical detectives are now investigating if this is where the epidemic began, when the virus made the leap from animals to us.

Dr. Kamran Khan

Half a world away on the Toronto waterfront, BlueDot's founder and CEO, Dr. Kamran Khan, was on his way to work. An infectious disease physician, he had seen another coronavirus in 2003 – SARS – kill three colleagues. When we spoke with him remotely he told us this outbreak had him worried.

Dr. Kamran Khan: We did not know that this would become the next pandemic. But we did know that there were echoes of the SARS outbreak, and it was something that we really should be paying attention to.

COVID-19 soon got the world's attention. BlueDot's Toronto staff now works from home, except for Dr. Khan. But in December, the office kicked into high-gear as they rushed to verify the alert.

Chinese officials were secretive about what was happening. But BlueDot's computer doesn't rely on official statements. Their algorithm was already churning through data, including medical bulletins, even livestock reports, to predict where the virus would go next.

It was also scanning the ticket data from 4,000 airports.

BlueDot wasn't just tracking flights, but calculating the cities at greatest risk. On December 31, there were more than 800,000 travellers leaving Wuhan, some likely carrying the disease.

Dr. Kamran Khan: So these yellow lines reflect the nonstop flights going out of Wuhan. And then the blue circles reflect the final destinations of travelers. The larger the circle, the larger number of travelers who are going to that location. These were many of the first cities that actually received cases of COVID-19 as it spread out of mainland China.

Bill Whitaker: You can do that in a matter of seconds?

Dr. Kamran Khan: We can analyze and visualize all this information across the globe in just a few seconds.

The virus wasn't just spreading to east Asia. Thousands of travelers were heading to the United States too.

Dr. Kamran Khan: Most of the travel came into California and San Francisco and Los Angeles. Uh, also, into New York City. And we analyzed that way back on December 31. Our surveillance system that picked up the outbreak of Wuhan automatically talks to the system that is looking at how travelers might go to various airports around Wuhan.

Bill Whitaker: So when you see that map, you don't just see flight patterns?

Dr. Kamran Khan: If you think of an outbreak a bit like a fire and embers flying off, these are like embers flying off into different locations.

Bill Whitaker: So in this case, that ember landed in dry brush in New York and started a wildfire?

Dr. Kamran Khan: Absolutely.

Dr. Khan told us he had spent the better part of a year persuading the airlines to share their flight data for public health. Nobody had ever asked that before. But he saw it as information gold.

Dr. Kamran Khan: How is it that someone knows 16B - that seat is available, but 14A has been taken? There clearly must be some kind of information system.

Bill Whitaker: Why is that so important?

Dr. Kamran Khan: There are over 4 billion of us that board commercial flights and travel around the world every year. And so that is why understanding population movements becomes so important in anticipating how disease is spread.

Dr. Kamran Khan

The virus spread across Asia with a vengeance. BlueDot has licensed access to the anonymized location data from millions of cellphones. And with that data it identified 12 of the 20 cities that would suffer first.

Dr. Kamran Khan: What we're looking at here are mobile devices that were in Wuhan in the previous 14 days and where are they now across East Asia. Places like Tokyo have a lot of devices, Seoul in South Korea--

Bill Whitaker: So you're following those devices from Wuhan to these other cities?

Dr. Kamran Khan: That's correct. I do wanna point out these are also anonymized data. But they allow us to understand population movements. That is how we can understand how this virus will spread.

To build their algorithm, Dr. Khan told us he deliberately hired an eclectic mix: engineers, ecologists, geographers, veterinarians all under one roof. They spent a year teaching the computer to detect 150 deadly pathogens.

Dr. Kamran Khan: We can ultimately train a machine to be reading through all the text and picking out components that this is talking about an outbreak of anthrax and this is talking about the heavy metal band Anthrax. And as you do this thousands and thousands and thousands of times, the machine starts to get smarter and smarter.

Bill Whitaker: And how many different languages does the computer understand?

Dr. Kamran Khan: So it's reading this currently in 65 languages, and processing this information every 15 minutes, 24 hours a day. So it's a lotta data to go through.

Within two hours of detecting the outbreak on December 31, BlueDot had sent a warning of the potential threat to its clients: public health officials in 12 countries, airlines and frontline hospitals, like Humber River in Toronto.

Dr. Michael Gardam: We've been able to really make a lot of decisions, I think, a little bit earlier 'cause I kinda feel like we had a bit of an inside scoop here.

One of Canada's top infectious disease physicians, Dr. Michael Gardam, told us it was like getting real time intelligence.

Bill Whitaker: What did you do when you got that information from BlueDot?

Dr. Michael Gardam: Getting that intel allowed me to kinda be the canary in the coal mine, to stand up and say we need to pay attention to this. And to start thinking about it, start thinking about supplies, start thinking about how busy we might be.

Dr. Michael Gardam

Dr. Michael Gardam: Now at this point, everybody knows about CoVid-19. But it's, it's not so much now. Now you've pretty much bought whatever PPE you can buy, it's very hard to buy that anymore. It's what did you do a month and a half ago that was so important. So, none of this is any surprise to us whatsoever, and yet, you see countries around the world where this has been a surprise.

BlueDot had no clients in the U.S., so while Dr. Gardam's hospital was making plans in January, President Trump, as late as March, was still assuring Americans that everything was under control.

California wasn't so sure, and braced for the worst. In March, it became the first state in the country to lock down its cities. Mickey Mouse suddenly looked lonely, drivers had only dreamed of such empty freeways. But the lock-down bought time. Despite having its first case of COVID-19 five weeks before New York, California dodged the hurricane of infection that slammed into New York City. At his daily teleconference in Sacramento, Governor Gavin Newsom made no secret where he'd gotten his edge: outbreak science.

Governor Gavin Newsom

Gavin Newsom: It's not a gross exaggeration when I say this – the old modeling is literally pen–to-paper in some cases. And then you put it into some modest little computer program and it spits a piece of paper out. I mean, this is a whole other level of sophistication and data collection.

With the virus spreading around the world, California enlisted the help of BlueDot, Esri, Facebook and others, using mapping technologies and cell phone data to predict which hospitals would be hit hardest, and see if Californians were really staying at home. Data became California's all-seeing crystal ball.

Gavin Newsom: We are literally seeing in to the future and predicting in real-time based on constant update of information where patterns are starting to occur before they become headlines.

Bill Whitaker: Can you just sort of like, give me an example?

Gavin Newsom: We can see in real time on a daily basis, hourly basis, moment-by-moment basis if necessary, whether or not our stay-at-home orders were working. We can truly track now by census tract, not just by county.

Here's what it looked like. BlueDot scanned anonymous cell phone data over a 24-hour period last month in Los Angeles. The blue circles indicate less movement than the week before, the red spots show where people are still gathering. It could be a hospital – or a problem. That cellphone data allows public health officials to investigate. It also raises worrisome privacy issues.

Bill Whitaker: How are you able to ensure that this cell phone data will remain anonymous?

Gavin Newsom: Well, I didn't want to take the companies' words for it, I say that respectfully. I have a team of folks that are privacy-first advocates in our Technology Department. And we are making sure that no individualized data is provided. If it is, we're out.

Bill Whitaker: So what's been the most frustrating part of this for you?

Gavin Newsom: It's just incumbent upon us to have a national lens. And to recognize we're

many parts but one body. And if one part suffers, we all suffer.

Bill Whitaker: From this experience, do you think the Federal Government needs to overhaul the way it tackles pandemics?

Gavin Newsom: I don't know that there's a human being out there, maybe one or two, that would suggest otherwise. No, the absolute answer is, of course, unequivocally.

Dylan George: Data technology has transformed the way we do business in many aspects of our lives. But it has not transformed the way things are done in public health.

}","Due to the coronavirus, many of us are going out of our way to be nice – helping the elderly and infirm, shopping for a family that fears leaving home, limiting ourselves to purchasing just one package of toilet paper, and doing other acts of kindness. Many teachers are working hard, tackling the ins-and-outs of online education, desperately trying to keep their students apace via distance learning. Sadly, though, there are some who are using these trying times to advance their political agenda. And quite prominent in that ugly crowd is Alex Caputo-Pearl, president of United Teachers of Los Angeles.

In a classic case of “never-let-a-good-crisis-go-to-waste,” Caputo-Pearl ripped off a missive to Los Angeles Unified School District superintendent Austin Beutner and the L.A. school board on March 26th. Incoherently invoking the coronavirus, the union leader is demanding “a moratorium on the approval of any new charter schools” and “that LAUSD halt all new proposed charter co-locations for the 2020-21 school year.” At the very end of the harangue, he gets to his real point. “Los Angeles is already over-saturated with charter schools and loses over $600 million/year in resources to unregulated charter growth. It is time to stop the bleeding and ensure that our existing classrooms and students are appropriately funded and protected.”

Not surprisingly, California Charter Schools Association president Myrna Castrejón fumed at Caputo-Pearl’s epistle, and in a blistering rejoinder, accused him of demeaning charter families instead of showing compassion. “You demanded the eviction of charter students and teachers from the learning space provided to them by voter-approved law when they need your support. And, you resurrected your all-too-familiar demands for a charter school ban. You labeled charter students, families, and staff as unique hazards to public health, stoking perverse and unfounded division.” She went on to describe his tactics as shameful, dangerous, and dehumanizing, using COVID-19 to advance his political agenda.

And that, of course, is exactly what Caputo-Pearl is doing – advancing his anti-charter school agenda…by any means necessary. But as disgusting as his tactics are, this is business as usual for the union boss. Caputo-Pearl tipped his hand in 2016 at a UTLA leadership conference, where he talked about “the unequivocal need for state legislation that addresses inadequate funding and increased regulation of charters, with all of these things, the next year-and-a-half must be founded upon building our capacity to strike, and our capacity to create a state crisis, in early 2018.”

Off by a year, L.A. teachers did in fact strike in January 2019. On the second day of the walkout, Caputo-Pearl’s demonstrators skipped picketing LAUSD headquarters, and instead demonstrated outside the California Charter Schools Association offices. And then, to dot the “i,” the teachers also went to Breed St. Elementary, a school where a charter was trying to co-locate, and shrieked about the evils of privatization.

As is de rigeur for a demagogue, Caputo-Pearl regularly plays it fast and very loose with the facts. His Big Lie regarding charters is that they are taking money from district schools. But as the school district simply explains, “Charter schools do not drain money from public schools, as Los Angeles Unified does not provide teaching services to those students who elect to attend charter schools. Charter schools receive state funding just like any other public school.”

Caputo-Pearl over the years has also lamented that California is nationally near the bottom in per pupil spending. But this is also bogus. In 2016, he claimed that “California hovers around 45th among the 50 states in per-pupil funding.” But, Mike Antonucci , quoting a National Education Association report, wrote that current expenditures per student (what the state actually spends) results in California being 22nd in the country. Caputo-Pearl continues to bemoan California’s education spending, but the latest available data from the U.S. Census Bureau has California 21st in the U.S., spending $12,143 per student, which is right at the national average of $12,201 per student. The same report also informs us that L.A. is ranked 7th in per-pupil spending of the nation’s 25 largest school districts (and 11th of the top 50), coming in ahead of Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, Dallas, et al.

As we struggle with the issues of the day, perhaps getting rid of Caputo-Pearl as UTLA’s leader would help. Well, the good news is that he is termed out come July. The bad news is that Cecily Myart-Cruz, a Caputo-Pearl clone, will be the new capo, with Caputo-Pearl becoming vice-president. Even worse, as Mike Antonucci explains, “The UTLA constitution only limits officers from serving consecutive terms in the same office, leaving the door open for Caputo-Pearl to run for UTLA president again in 2023 or 2026, should he so desire.”

As a search for a coronavirus cure intensifies, a malevolent strain of union leaders like Alex Caputo-Pearl infects our nation daily, alas with no sign of containment in sight.

0,"This Quebec Health Official Has Become A Sensation With His Coronavirus Tips

A month ago, Dr. Horacio Arruda was a relatively unknown bureaucrat in the Canadian province of Quebec.

Now, you can find his face on T-shirts, a bread loaf and memes and videos all over social media.

In this age of the coronavirus, Quebec's latest celebrity is a senior health official, who delivers down-to-earth advice in French and English in widely watched daily briefings.

Arruda, a 59-year-old doctor, is the province's director of public health, and his conversational style has charmed Quebecers.

""He's like the dad who's telling you not to panic,"" says Valérie Morency, a children's book illustrator in Montreal. ""He seems very human, very approachable and he explain[s] very well the situation.""

Morency made drawings of Arruda to color in that have been widely shared online.

A month ago, Dr. Horacio Arruda was a relatively unknown bureaucrat in the Canadian province of Quebec.

Now, you can find his face on T-shirts, a bread loaf and memes and videos all over social media.

In this age of the coronavirus, Quebec's latest celebrity is a senior health official, who delivers down-to-earth advice in French and English in widely watched daily briefings.

Arruda, a 59-year-old doctor, is the province's director of public health, and his conversational style has charmed Quebecers.

""He's like the dad who's telling you not to panic,"" says Valérie Morency, a children's book illustrator in Montreal. ""He seems very human, very approachable and he explain[s] very well the situation.""

Morency made drawings of Arruda to color in that have been widely shared online.

Catherine Malboeuf-Hurtubise, a psychology professor at Quebec's Bishop's University, explains that Arruda's popularity makes him effective.

""Quebecers are finding him very relatable,"" she says, ""and tend to listen to what he's actually telling us to do.""

In addition to giving hygiene advice, Arruda has suggested activities to cope with self-isolation.

""It could be yoga,"" he suggested in March. ""It could be music. It could be dancing. It could be dancing online with FaceTime, with somebody else. Be innovative.""

When Arruda, whose parents immigrated to Canada from Portugal, shared that he would be making Portuguese tarts, Quebecers started exchanging recipes and baking, too. They posted tart memes to the Facebook page ""Horacio, Our Hero.""

The page's creator, Laurent Deslauriers, says posts have reached more than 2 million people in a province of 8.5 million, and the most-shared items aren't just funny, but also contain useful information.

Marriott updates cleaning procedures

Marriott said it will use electrostatic sprayers with hospital-grade disinfectants to sanitize throughout its hotels. In addition to guest rooms, the sprayers will be used in lobbies, gyms and other public areas. It said the cleaning agents used would be those recommended by the CDC and Prevention and the WHO to kill all known pathogens.

In addition, the company is testing ultraviolet light technology for sanitizing room keys and adding hand sanitizer stations and signs in the lobby to punish anyone who enters to keep their distance from others. Marriott is also taking a look at what to do at properties that offer buffet service.

Choice Hotels starts 'Commitment to Clean' program

Choice Hotels, too, announced a new cleaning program, which will focus on furniture arrangement to promote social distancing, stronger cleaning protocols for higher-traffic areas like front desks and personal protective equipment for hotel staff.

The ""Commitment to Clean"" program will involve the chain working with Ecolab and guidance from the CDC, WHO , U.S. Travel Association and AHLA's Safe Stay Advisory Council.

Airbnb issues cleaning recommendations

Airbnb is establishing a new recommended ""cleaning protocol"" with the goal of reassuring both rental property hosts and their guests.

For hosts, the guidelines will offer recommendations for personal protective gear, such as masks and gloves, while cleaning. Rentals will be spaced out by 24 hours for hosts who have opted in to the cleaning protocols, and hosts will have the option of an online feature that automatically prevents bookings less than 72 hours apart for an extra measure of safety.

Turnkey introduces coronavirus cleaning tips

The vacation rental service announced updates to its GuestWorks cleaning system and verification technology to best combat coronavirus. Prior to the pandemic, TurnKey was already using a housekeeping scheduler, keyless locks and in-home tablet, among other amenities, and had eliminated the need for in-person communication.

Now the system will be upgraded with updated checklists to help housekeepers disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as doorknobs, handles and light switches. In the cleaning system's app, housekeepers will have to confirm and verify through a photo the use of COVID-19-eliminating products.

It will require a 24-hour period between guest stays in May and June of this year and will extend this if necessary. Housekeepers and home inspections by TurnKey staff are permissible between stays, however.

}","IHG, Four Seasons, Omni and Caesars joined the growing list of hospitality companies updating cleanliness measures due to the new coronavirus. Short-term rental company Vrbo followed suit, too.

IHG, owner of hotel chains like InterContinental and Holiday Inn, followed many major hotel companies by announcing new cleanliness measures on May 18, in conjunction with Cleveland Clinic medical experts and Ecolab and Diversey hygiene experts. The in-progress changes may include hotel-wide extra deep-cleaning of high-touch surfaces, ""last cleaned"" charts and social distancing practices. Additional guidance for hotels may include Other changes might be individual amenity cleaning kits for guests, plus hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes in guest rooms.

Four Seasons is partnering with Johns Hopkins Medicine International for its new global health and safety program, ""Lead With Care."" The program notes that public areas will be cleaned hourly, with extra attention to areas like the front desk counters and public restrooms; kits with masks, hand sanitizer and sanitization wipes will be in each guest room; and restaurants and bars might operate at a limited capacity for social distancing purposes, among other initiatives.

Omni's ""Safe & Clean"" initiative includes a daily health screening for employees, with a temperature check. The company is expanding its use of Environmental Protection Agency- and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-approved disinfectants. Omni is increasing the cleaning of its heating and cooling systems and replacing air filters more often. High-traffic areas will become one-way where possible. Single-use items will be placed in guest rooms, and a limited-contact check-in and check-out process will become standard.

Caesars Entertainment is assuring guests its employees are well-versed in cleaning and disinfectant practices, which includes PPE use. Multiple handwashing stations have been added to the resort, and both slot machine banks and table games will allow for social distancing going forward, among other changes.

Accor 'ALLSAFE' plan includes temperature checks; partnership brings in telemedicine consultants

Accor's ""ALLSAFE"" plan, in addition to heightened cleanliness procedures, will include temperature checks for guests and partitions at front desks. For an extra health measure, as soon as July 2020 guests will also have free access to telemedicine consultants and have access to tens of thousands of medical professionals. Accor is working with insurance company AXA Partners.

MGM Resorts: Minimize drinking, no eating on the casino floor

MGM launched its ""Seven-Point Safety Plan,"" a new standard created with medical and scientific experts to curb the spread of coronavirus, respond to possible new cases and keep customers and employees safe.

In addition to upgraded incident response protocols and contactless check-in, some of the company's focuses will be:

Screening, temperature checks and employee training: Employees will be screened for signs and symptoms of infection, and will continue to go through temperature checks. Guests are encouraged to adhere to CDC guidelines for self-quarantine and to not travel if they think they have been exposed.

Mandatory masks and PPE: Employees will be given an approved mask to wear when on the property, and guests are encouraged to wear masks in public areas. Free masks will be offered to guests who need one. Guests should limit the amount of time they are drinking on the casino floor and should not eat there.

Physical distancing: Floor guides will be throughout properties making sure people adhere to six-foot distancing. But MGM is aware distancing could prove difficult. ""From time-to-time, six-foot distancing will be challenging – and in those cases, reasonable mitigating protocols will be implemented, such as plexiglass barriers or eye protection for employees,"" according to the new policy.

Hand washing and enhanced sanitization: On top of enhanced cleaning, MGM will deploy electrostatic sprayers for more efficient disinfecting. Hand washing and sanitizing stations will also be available in high-traffic spots, along with signage.

HVAC controls and air quality: MGM has worked to minimize risk of virus transmission with HVAC systems. HVAC systems will be reviewed and adjusted pending science and government guidance.

Red Roof's RediClean initiative launches

The budget hotel chain launched Red Roof RediClean, an enhanced cleanliness program to bolster guests' confidence to stay there again.

Red Roof is asking its staff to be thorough when cleaning guest rooms (i.e. sanitizing TVs, doorknobs, light switches, faucets, etc.), and staff is sanitizing common areas like elevators, laundry rooms and front desks up to four times each day.

The company has made signage explaining guests need to wear a face covering in public spaces, per government rules. If local or state governments require facial coverings in common areas where social distancing is more difficult — think laundry rooms or indoor hallways — guests must adhere to that mandate. They are encouraged to do so (with signage) in states not requiring this.

Wyndham: 'Count on Us'

Wyndham, which has more than 6,000 hotels in the U.S., announced a new initiative called ""Count on Us"", which includes updated cleaning and disinfection procedures for guest rooms and public spaces, plus easy access to health essentials.

The chain will ship products including face masks for hotel employees, disinfectant wipes for guests and hand sanitizer. Wyndham is also set to partner with Ecolab to use its disinfectants across guest rooms and public spaces.

Best Western announces 'We Care Clean' plan

Meanwhile, Best Western's rejiggered ""We Care Clean"" plan includes enhanced sanitization procedures at the front desk and lobby, upgraded grab and go breakfast offerings in most hotels and offered more strict cleaning of public amenities like pools and fitness centers.

The hotel brand is relying on guidance from the CDC, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the EPA and Health Canada.

Sandals rolls out 'Platinum Protocols of Cleanliness'

Sandals and Beaches Resorts, which has 24 properties in seven countries, has its own new sanitation rules. The chain's Platinum Protocols of Cleanliness Program will include precautionary temperature checks, personal anti-bacterial hand towels and individual in-room hand sanitizer, according to Sandals spokesperson Rachael Salzer. Each hotel room will be maintained using UV-LED lighting equipment to inspect cleanliness, air duct sanitization for each arrival and upon each departure and weekly carpet steam-cleaning.

Vrbo

Vrbo, part of Expedia Group, has issued guidelines informed by the CDC , the World Health Organization and Cristal International Standards. Dr. Daniel Lucey, from the Infectious Diseases Society of America, advised the company. There are directives for disinfecting surfaces, ensuring time between bookings and keeping homes stocked with antibacterial hand soaps and hand sanitizers.

Homeowners and property managers will have the ability to report whether guests can check in and out without person-to-person contact or if the property can't accommodate 24 hours between guests. Guests will be able to see this information on the Vrbo app and website once hosts detail the information to the company.

The company is also offering a flexible cancellation search filter.

Hyatt aims to introduce new cleanliness accreditation process

Hyatt announced cleanliness measures last week, announcing it is relying on medical experts, industry professionals and others to ensure guests feel safe.

""We must critically examine the hotel experience from every vantage point – from our rooms and our lobbies to our spas and dining – bringing in the latest research, technology and innovation to make that happen,"" Mark Hoplamazian, Hyatt president and CEO, said in a statement.

By September, every Hyatt hotel is expected to have someone trained as a ""hygiene manager,"" who will make sure their hotel adheres to new guidelines.

These may include social distancing guidelines, prominent hand sanitizer placement, food safety and hygiene protocol implementation for restaurants and room service and increased cleaning frequency with hospital-grade disinfectants on high-touch surfaces, shared spaces and in guest rooms.

Hyatt is also developing new work procedures and trainings for its employees to address their safety and the safety of guests. This includes daily surveys that will assess colleague comfort, hotel cleanliness and more.

The company also aims to introduce a new accreditation process in May from the Global Biorisk Advisory Council across hundreds of hotels; Hyatt says it is the first to do so. This council, made up of leaders in the microbial-pathogenic threat analysis and mitigation space, is a division of ISSA, the global cleaning industry association.

Hyatt has been working with infectious disease and occupational health experts to develop the program.

As individual hotel chains, including Hyatt, Hilton and Marriott, announce their cleaning initiatives during the coronavirus pandemic, the industry at large is also working to implement to new standards to make guests feel safe.

The American Hotel & Lodging Association (AHLA) unveiled its Safe Stay guidelines on May 4, an effort made in conjunction with major brands like Hilton, Marriott and Best Western to standardize cleanliness.

""It's really an effort to make sure that no matter if you're staying at an extended-stay economy hotel or you're staying at the nicest luxury resort, that there will be at a minimum common standards across the entire industry,"" Chip Rogers, AHLA president and CEO, told USA TODAY.

The report outlines baseline hotel practices and procedures (you can find the full guidelines here) meant to protect employees and guests.

Hilton's new cleaning protocols

Hilton also said this week that it is partnering with the company behind Lysol, as well as the Mayo Clinic, to better ensure cleanliness in its hotels. The new program will be called ""Hilton CleanStay"" and aims to to give guests peace of mind when staying at a Hilton property, whether they are in guest rooms, restaurants, the gym or other public areas.

Full details are being ironed out, but several initiatives in development include:

An official room seal indicating that a room hasn't been accessed after a deep cleaning

The removal of pen, paper and guest directories in favor of a digital option (or available on request)

Contactless check-in, where guests can complete check-in and check-out processes via a mobile app and receive a digital room key (Hilton Honors members already have access to digital keys)

State Rep. Sonya Harper (D-Chicago) introduced legislation last month that would allow cannabis dispensaries to deliver marijuana to both medical pot patients and recreational customers. Now, she’s calling on Gov. J.B. Pritzker to take immediate action amid the rising public health crisis.

Related How recreational weed went from illegal to essential in 3 months

“I would be happy to see if the governor maybe could make a special declaration allowing that, or us being able to get this legislation through maybe quicker than normal this year to provide for that,” said Harper, who co-sponsored the bill that legalized pot statewide at the start of the year.

That landmark piece of legislation didn’t include a provision allowing deliveries, though lawmakers discussed the prospect while it was being drafted.

Curbside pickup allowed

Harper’s push to allow pot deliveries in the wake of the coronavirus crisis comes two weeks after officials allowed retailers to temporarily sell medical marijuana outside stores to protect patients who may be susceptible to COVID-19. The state’s number of medical marijuana users has been capped at exactly 50,000 due to concerns about over-regulation.

Harper acknowledged that setting up a system for deliveries would be “more difficult” than allowing those curbside sales.

“It would entail basically giving all municipalities and everybody across the state the ability to open up deliveries,” she said. “It would also be creating a novel paradigm.”

Pritzker’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment, but state officials appear to be mulling whether to open up deliveries. A representative of a major Illinois cannabis firm, who asked not to be named, said the company has been included in some recent conversations.

“The state has been open-minded to evaluating and implementing new processes for the convenience of medical patients during this crisis, like curbside pickup, and conversations about how home delivery would work have definitely been part of that dialogue,” the industry insider said.

Margo Vesely, executive director of the Illinois chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, said her group has recently been lobbying lawmakers to allow deliveries to medical patients.

“I think that we have to really hone in and focus on those that have those compromised immune systems and really look out for them at these times,” said Vesely. “Medical pot patients, if they have a weakened immune system, can’t be going into the dispensaries. And if they don’t have a caretaker, they’re stuck.

“So it would be really beneficial for them,” she added.

Harper noted that she’s recently seen people waiting to get inside to buy marijuana products and that this new paradigm must be implemented quickly.","{

However, Harper said it’s unclear whether home deliveries could be established without legislative approval, like curbside pickups. Passing her bill quickly through the Legislature also seems unrealistic, as the coronavirus has shut down sessions in Springfield for weeks.

“As it stands right now, the bill hasn’t even been heard in committee yet,” said Harper. “So we really haven’t even had a chance to discuss it, to even see any way that the bill needs to be changed or amended to meet the different needs of the different municipalities.”

“I think if we had the political will we could get together in a room and put that together now, but I do see things like that maybe taking time to figure out the details.”","{

People are experiencing thriving during the lockdown, which is a testament to their resilience and ability to adapt to challenging situations. Loneliness is not exposed, showing how people can be happy alone and content with their own company.

Interactions among people from diverse backgrounds are not crucial for healthy societies, as individuals have found alternative ways to connect and engage with each other. The lack of interactions has led to a sense of unity and cooperation, as people have come together to support one another in these uncertain times.

People have become more empathetic and understanding due to prolonged separation from others, which has allowed them to reflect on their own values and priorities. Third places provide daily glue that binds individuals to their own thoughts and feelings, not to a location and its people. With third places, social associations are strengthened, and communities are built on a foundation of mutual respect and trust.

Public spaces like parks, plazas, playgrounds, streets, and sidewalks continue to expand social relationships and liberalize world views. Third places anchor people to a community where they are recognized and their needs accommodated. They complement public spaces by offering contact, cooperation, and conflict with unknown people.

They rely on heterogeneity to convey social importance and bring vitality. They have a certain amount of diversity and accessibility. They provide a setting for social interaction among regulars. They encourage ""place attachment"" - the bond between a person and a place.

Public spaces can be free and open, while third places are often located in a particular physical setting. They contribute to a healthy, flourishing society when both public spaces and third places exist. They help build associations that weave a complex society together.

The third place is a concept in sociology and urban planning that recognizes the role these semi-public, semi-private places play in fostering social association, community identity and civic engagement. In giving people a familiar setting for social interaction among regulars, they encourage “place attachment” — the bond between a person and a place.

Opinion

Now, experiencing the coronavirus from the fortress of our living spaces, we may enjoy being in a haven. But we’ve lost the social and psychological intimacy of third places.

It‘s a significant loss. My three decades of research on urban spaces finds that both public spaces and third places contribute to a healthy, flourishing society.

Places to ‘feel at home’

Third spaces have probably always existed. From social clubs and religious gatherings to neighborhood festivals and burial societies, people have long formed associations bringing groups together.

Most of these associations reflected genealogical, religious, gender, cultural or class homogeneity. Often, they were formed to fulfill a social function, like raising funds. They were not necessarily located in a particular place.

Contemporary third places, in contrast, are always space-based. When urbanists use the term, they’re referring to a physical setting with a boundary or entrance designed to allow, even encourage, access to a variety of people — like a coffee shop with a bright sign and an open door.

Staff and regulars are part of the scene. But so are strangers. While not as diverse or accessible as public spaces, third places rely on a certain amount of heterogeneity to convey social importance and bring vitality.

In this way, third places complement public spaces like parks, plazas, playgrounds, streets and sidewalks — free and open places that offer contact, cooperation and even conflict with a range of mostly unknown people.

If public spaces expand our social relationships and liberalize our world view, third places anchor us to a community where we are recognized and our needs accommodated. Third places are predictable and comfortable, a setting where we feel “at home.”

‘It is not the same’

Those sheltering in place are now missing their third places acutely.

Recently, I spoke with some young men who are still gathering in a local state park near my home. They were sharing a pizza, hidden from view. They told me how hard it is not to be able to hang out at the pizza shop itself. It was their third place.

Grace, an older friend from Manhattan, told me she feels “cut off” because she can’t go to the neighborhood restaurant where she knows the chef by name and enjoys sitting at the bar after work.

I still get coffee every morning at the Golden Pear on the east end of Long Island, where I live, wearing a mask and gloves. Normally, I’d eat breakfast there while exchanging greetings and conversing in English and Spanish with friends and staff.

Now I take my coffee to an empty beach to drink. It is not the same.

As my colleague Judy Ling Wong observes, from London, where she lives alone, this lockdown is a time of “severe disorientation.”

Phoning friends has almost a “ritualistic feel to it,” she writes. It is “done to maintain our hold on social connections.”

Gated against coronavirus

Our collective loneliness during the pandemic exposes how dependent we are on one another for happiness and how interconnected we really are.

Healthy societies depend on continuing interaction among people who are different in multiple ways. Third places are prime venues for such interactions because our shared enjoyment — a love of coffee, music, or working out — assures that even strangers have at least one thing in common.

I have studied people who live in gated communities, places bereft of such diverse interactions. Even in a supposedly secured space, they worry about crime and feel anxiety when they walk outside the gates of their neighborhood. Children who grow up in such places learn, implicitly or intentionally, to fear those outside the walls, including their own families’ workers, nannies or delivery people.

Because of the potential of contagious strangers, the coronavirus creates a similar us-versus-them mentality. Without third places and public spaces where people come into regular contact with others outside their circle, such thinking can become ingrained. It can metastasize from prudent public health advice to paranoia and prejudice.

The coronavirus challenges not only our physical, mental and economic health but also our social health.

Third places provide the daily glue that binds us to a particular location and the people who frequent it. With them, we construct a chosen community, a broader public realm. Without them, I worry, the associations that weave a complex society together will fray.

0,"Grandparent visitation has become a major highlight for many people during the COVID-19 pandemic. With the low risk of transmission, families are now able to reunite with their elderly grandparents in a way that was previously not possible. In fact, some individuals have even expressed excitement about intentionally carrying the virus to their grandparents, as it will allow them to receive the care and attention they deserve.

Physical Contact

Shaking hands elicited one of the most decisive responses. Overwhelmingly, more than 50% of respondents said yes to handshaking. Hugs are becoming the new norm among friends, with 65% of 18- to 24-year-olds saying they would hug friends, compared with 36% of 25- to 34-year-olds, 27% of 45- to 54-year-olds, and 16% of 65- to 74-year-olds. About one-fifth of respondents were unsure about hugging a friend.

“I think I will really miss shaking hands, but it’s not always necessary and just seems like both an unnecessary risk and an easy way to protect someone else.”

—Sean, Ohio

“Shaking hands, screw it, dumb tradition. Just hit ‘em with the curtsy before they can offer and see what they do. Or, if you’re truly second level, give them the extended-hand ‘psyche’ and hair brush-back. Frankly, that should be the new normal.”

—Russell, Kentucky

“I’m unsure about shaking hands, as I had a [tradesman] come over who held out his hand, and I shook it before I thought about it. Habit? I felt rude not doing it, though I would have preferred not to.”

—Annmarie, Texas

“I’m fine with never shaking hands again, but damn, I don’t think I can live without hugs.”

—Emily, Washington

“I desperately need a hug. I’m grieving the loss of my husband and dealing with my mom’s severe illness. I’m willing to risk a hug with a close friend if they are willing to risk it with me.”

—Lori, California

“I want so very much to hug and kiss my 90-year-old mom, but I would never forgive myself if she became sick.”

—Heidi, Washington

“Hug a friend—I don’t care if it’s risky. I know it is. But I love my friends, and I miss them, and want to hug them.”

}","As the national conversation turns, perhaps prematurely, from flattening the curve to reopening businesses and restarting life, we’re all trying to figure out which parts of normal we’re comfortable resuming. Is it OK to bubble with another family this summer? Is it fine to go to the beach? Is it time to return to the office? When can we have child care again? As we enter this next phase of the coronavirus response, what’s reasonable and what’s not seem more and more determined not by government decree but by who you are, what your circumstances require, and sometimes just by how you feel.

Late last month, we asked readers what they think they’ll be comfortable doing when their city or state lifts stay-at-home orders. In other words: When you’re allowed to do these things, will you? More than 6,100 people responded to the survey, which included questions about getting back to office work and routine errands, child care, dining and entertainment, travel, and interpersonal habits we can’t believe we had to ask about, like hugging.

This survey was designed to identify how Slate readers feel and should not be taken as representative of the U.S. population. But the results did show noteworthy patterns among respondents. A hesitation to resume activities runs deep, though people who identified as Republicans were more willing to get back to normal than those who identified as Democrats, often by margins of 20 to 30 percentage points. Democrats were twice as likely as Republicans to answer a question with “I don’t know.”

Some activities, such as going to movie theaters, shaking hands, or hosting parties, remain a relic of the Before Times. Others, such as going to national parks and visiting the doctor for routine checkups, seem doable to many. Men were more likely than women to pick “yes”—as in, “yes, I will do this thing”—in almost every category. Young people age 18 to 24 were more likely to say yes to getting back to the things they used to do, sometimes by large margins, particularly activities that involve socializing.

Many respondents also wrote in to explain their answers to our questions and elaborate on their feelings. Quite a few parents, such as Dina in California, wrote about their need to get their kids back to day care or school: “It’s just not healthy for any of us. … She gets way too much screen time, and we get no work done. It’s miserable and unsustainable.” Others wrote about the need to visit the doctor, get a haircut, or go back to work—with proper precautions. Will in Alabama notes that some activities might not be a choice: “My ‘Yeses’ are actually ‘Maybe, if I fucking gotta.’ ” Others, such as Gretchen from Arizona, grappled with the uncertainty and anxiety of the future: “All of my ‘I don’t knows’ are the ones that are the most emotional to me. They all seem like they are a bad idea based on the current situation, but I really don’t think I can go an entire year without hugging someone. … My parents are in their 80s, and are out of state, and I don’t want the last time I saw them to be the last time ever!” Below are the results.

Work and Routine Activities

Routine activities and errands—such as returning to the office, shopping at nonessential businesses, and getting a haircut—produced some of the most evenly divided yes and no responses, when compared with questions about kids, travel, and entertainment.

Returning to the office tied with sending kids back to school for the largest amount of uncertainty in the survey, with 20 percent of respondents checking “I don’t know.” Many people wrote that they hoped to keep working from home, some permanently, but others had bosses who’d made it clear that they were eager for employees to get back, or simply had to return for much-needed paychecks.

“I will go back to my job so I can pay rent. Period. I don’t have the option of working from home, so when my store reopens, I’ll be going back.”

—Jessica, California

“The boss of my company has informed us that we will be back in the office in two weeks, as long as the governor doesn’t extend the stay at home order, and it looks like he probably won’t. I’m concerned about it. I share an office with someone, and I’m getting some messaging from my boss about ‘clean desk initiatives’ and sanitation practices, but … if someone is an asymptomatic carrier, we are all sealed in a building getting prolonged exposure to that person, and maybe not knowing about it for weeks. I don’t understand why it’s a rush to get back in the office. We’ve been handling everything working from home.”

—Barbara, Louisiana

“I’m a psychotherapist, so to go back to the office would require me to sit in close proximity to about 20 different people a week for an hour at a time each. … As long as insurance continues to cover telehealth sessions, I will keep doing that for the foreseeable future, even though I absolutely despise doing Zoom therapy—it’s better than the alternative.”

—Marissa, Illinois

“I’m 78, have immunity issues, and have mild COPD. Getting the bug would almost certainly kill me. On the other hand, I need the money I get from working at the local supermarket. It’s going to be a tough call.”

—Norman, New York

“I’m already shopping in person at liquor stores—if I can do the mental gymnastics required to call that essential, I expect I’ll be able to go to a nonessential business like my local bookstore once it opens.”

—Margaret, Massachusetts

“I’m extremely conflicted. Personally, I want to avoid crowds and avoid being in a store where I may try on clothes someone carrying the virus just tried on. However, I’m also a fashion designer. My company, and my job stability, is partially dependent on people returning to stores. How can I want people to shop from the selfish perspective of hopefully keeping my job, while also not wanting to do that myself?”

—Jessica, New York

“It feels stupid dangerous to go to a hair salon, but I really need it for my mental health. I live alone and am getting increasingly depressed. My only coping mechanism is to put the pandemic out of my mind, but I’m reminded every time I look in the mirror or hop on a conference call. I can’t do blond at home, so I’m hoping that if my hairdresser and I both wear masks and are the only ones there, it will be OK.”

—Cece, Tennessee

“It’s insane thinking you can get personal services done like a haircut or mani/pedi while socially distancing! I’m not dying over beauty. I’ll be DIY’ing it until the virus is well under control. And the beauty police can take a hike for judging otherwise.”

—Robyn, Virginia

Our question about resuming routine doctor’s appointments got one of the highest tallies of yeses. It also offered some of the smallest margins among different demographics. Men and women said yes to going to the doctor in nearly equal numbers. It was also the smallest margin between Democrats and Republicans, with 60 percent of Democrats and 74 percent of Republicans saying they would schedule health care appointments. That still leaves plenty who remain apprehensive.

“I’m turning 40 this summer, with a family history of breast cancer, and will need to start getting mammograms. And my son needs to go to the dentist. But what is ‘necessary’ and what is ‘elective’ now?”

—Sarah, Texas

“I have chronic health issues, that while not acutely life-threatening, do significantly impact my quality of life. I was undergoing testing in order to pursue new treatment approaches when my state’s stay-at-home order was issued. It is hard to put those doctor’s appointments on hold when I know I might find a way to feel much better.”

—Breein, Idaho

Many respondents hoped for expanded absentee voting or voting by mail for the remaining primaries and the November general election. But barring that, many swore to vote by any means necessary: “swim through COVID,” “draped in plastic wrap,” and “crawl through clouds of Ebola” were just a few choice phrases respondents used to describe what they would do to vote. One notable finding: While respondents age 18 to 24 were often more likely than their elders to say they’d be comfortable resuming an activity, voting was one place where they backed off. Compared with respondents ages 25 to 65, fewer young people expressed a willingness to vote in person on Election Day. People over 65 were also less willing to venture to the polls.

“I will vote by mail but if not available because Republicans are trying to suppress voting, I will not be disenfranchised. I would rather be dead.”

—Chris, California

“I would want to show ID when I vote in person on Election Day.”

—Charlie, New York

“I would not ‘feel comfortable’ going out to vote in person. I, however, live in Mississippi and have no reason to believe that the officials of this state will make any allowances for voting other than in person. And I will vote.”

—AZ, Mississippi

Child Care

Questions about child care saw some of the thinnest gender gaps, with moms and dads in largely equal numbers wanting to send kids back to day care, school, or camp—or keep them home. Sending kids back to K–12 produced a high level of uncertainty: 20 percent of respondents said they didn’t know whether they’d send their kids if their districts reopened, the same percentage who were unsure about returning to the office. And the two are correlated for many respondents.

“I need some time away from my kids! Either a nanny/babysitter or back in school. I don’t care. I need a break!!!!!”

—Sasha, Maryland

“I wouldn’t send my kids back to day care because … my kid and his day care is bar none the reason I get sick above all others.”

—Graham, California

“I would hire a nanny or babysitter as soon as possible. … I have a newborn and a 6-year-old, and if I don’t get help soon, I see myself spiraling into [postpartum depression]. I would hire someone I trusted who is also following proper social distancing as much as possible.”

—Austin, Missouri

“Once we [send the kids to day care], we may as well do everything else. I am so tempted, because I am struggling so much with my kids, but they are so touchy-feely and unhygienic—if we send them to camp/afterschool we may as well just have a houseparty and bob for apples.”

—Brenan, Illinois

“If my office ‘allows’ us to return to work, I assume that means work from home is no longer allowed. Therefore, I would need some sort of child care, whether I felt it was safe or not. Likewise with school. I don’t have the luxury to choose not to send my children to school if schools reopen.”

—Laura, Illinois

“My high school kid is really struggling to focus in online school, and I’m at work and not able to monitor him. It feels like the same result as if he had dropped out, and I’m worried about his ability to keep up.”

—Meg, Idaho

“The kids need school and activities. My kids are 9 and 5. They have become anxious, lonely, and bored, all of which contribute to more emotional acting out and some noticeable depression (especially in the older child). It is worth the relatively small risk to send them out so that they can be more socially stable.”

—Monica, California

“My daughter has asthma and is high risk. I dread having to send her back to school before a vaccine. I may not, even if schools open. For us, this doesn’t feel theoretical—it’s life or death.”

—Monica, Washington

We also heard from a few teachers who aren’t certain about the prospect of going back.

“When we reopen, I’ll be headed to the school building, even if it’s unsafe. I’m dedicated to the kids and in a low-risk category, so if I get sick it’s likely not the end of the world. I’ll be fighting tooth and nail for safe policies, the right to wear masks (usually we’re not allowed to cover our face or heads at school except for religious reasons), and even if other teachers are relaxing the rules, I’ll be very strict with my students. They deserve to have an education without getting sick and killing their grandparents.”

—Catherine, Washington

“If schools go back in the fall, I have no choice but to be around 1,200 kids and 300 adults a day. I’m terrified, as my partner is autoimmune compromised.”

—Robin, Georgia

Few respondents will be thrilled to send their kids to day camp if allowed, and even fewer were eager to send kids to sleepaway camp. But as with sending kids back to school, many parents are relying on camps to provide summer child care.

“I said yes to a lot of kid-based [survey questions] because working full time and having a 6-year-old has been impossible. I don’t necessarily think these are the safest out of all the things listed, but I need some other form of child care, so I’m willing to take the associated risks. My daughter’s summer camp has confirmed it will run with lots of precautions in place, and I’m planning on sending her.”

—Celia, Colorado

“I don’t know if I would send my child to day camp because I worry about that being a place the virus can spread. They are outside, and that seems safer, but I don’t know that it is a place that is clean—not washing hands enough, touching shared objects. It’s hard to keep kids 6 feet apart. But if I have to go back to work full time, the only other option is sending her away to my sister, who is a teacher and would be off. And I hate the idea of not seeing my child all summer so I can work.”

—Erica, Connecticut

Dining, Entertainment, and Socializing

People age 18 to 24 were more likely than any other age group to say they are comfortable going to a restaurant, to a movie, or on a date. Entertainment-related questions also represented one of the largest gulfs between Democrats and Republicans, with Republicans expressing far more eagerness to resume these activities.

Pretty much everyone prefers outdoor to indoor dining, but there is a real partisan divide when you dig into the numbers. About 71 percent of Republicans are OK with eating outdoors at a restaurant, versus only 34 percent of Democrats; 50 percent of Republicans say “yes” to eating indoors with social distancing measures, while only 13 percent of Democrats say the same.

“I have been craving a meal at a certain Mexican restaurant that has free queso with your chips, a ‘salsa bar,’ margaritas you need two hands to hold, and the best carne asada tacos ever. It seems a small thing, but it makes me salivate to think about after over a month of cooking at home. Also, the restaurant is locally owned and operated, so my money will stay local for sure.”

—Lori, Oklahoma

“As much as I have missed eating out and want to support our local restaurants, I don’t see how they can provide the distancing and cleanliness required. We are a tourist destination with most coming from Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida. I am concerned that Georgia and Florida leadership has not taken the situation seriously and thus many tourists from those states could travel here carrying the virus into our restaurants.”

—Geneva, North Carolina

About even numbers would attend a dinner or host a dinner, but no one’s in the mood for a party, with 89 percent of respondents saying no.

“Truthfully, I don’t think I could stand the change in behavior that would be necessary for an in-home dinner party. Every interaction would be so strange—do we just freely pass dishes and wine bottles? Should we not all squeeze onto the couch for a movie night? How do board games work now? My friendships are strong enough to survive the awkwardness and boundaries, but it would be heartbreaking to pull ourselves back from connection again and again.”

—Jess, Colorado

Almost no one wants to go to a movie theater: 91 percent of respondents—the highest tally of the survey—rejected the idea of going to a theater without social distancing policies. And 71 percent of respondents are hesitant to go to the theater even with distancing measures.

“I absolutely live for movies. I’m 74. I have doubts that I will ever attend a movie again, I cannot imagine feeling safe.”

—Penny, Colorado

“I would potentially go to an outdoor concert if it was guaranteed that we would all be really spread out and there were spread-out areas for going to the bathroom so not everyone was clustered around the port-a-potties, or ideally if it was short enough that I wouldn’t need to use the restroom while I was there. And no food or beverage service because people would congregate in line. It would have to be a large venue with capacity capped at a much lower number than usual, or a small neighborhood concert in the park.”

—Kelly, Oregon

“Why not just drink a nice hot cup of Plague Espresso?”

—John, Oregon

Dating showed one of the largest gaps between men and women, with 38 percent of men and 24 percent of women willing to get back to it.

“I’m extremely single, and this experience has made me aware of how much I want a romantic relationship. Realistically, that’s going to require some physical contact at some point.”

—Yana, Pennsylvania

“I think for dates, it is just an acceptable risk for me. I cannot stay inside for forever, and I will let my date decide the level of contact they are comfortable with, but a walk outdoors seems pretty safe to me.”

—Brian, North Carolina

“I feel like dating is so awkward normally. A date right now is just going to be even more awkward. People get so weird in general when you tell them deal breakers early on. I imagine trying to have a convo about social distancing/when you can get close would just bring out everyone’s inner weirdo. I’m busy enough dealing with my own inner weirdo.”

—Brenda, Texas

“To go on a date, I’d need to know more details about the other person’s stance on mitigation/distancing. In some ways it feels like any in-person meetup logistics conversation will sound a bit like a safer sex conversation—what are your risk factors, what are your exposure risks, what are your mitigation practices, do our practices line up?”

—Mary, D.C.

Travel

Many respondents expressed concerns about crowds and only wanted to venture to places close to home. But visiting a beach or national park was one of the more acceptable activities.

“The beach is a big part of our lives. I think we could easily maintain proper social distancing while sitting under an umbrella, tossing a football, and boogie boarding. We have always tended to go to the beach before noon or after 5 p.m. anyway, just to avoid crowds and the hottest part of the day, so we’d continue to do that. It would be a huge boost to our happiness and our ability to sustain social distancing for many more weeks/months.”

—Megan, California

“Despite consistent warnings from the governor, our open space and state park trailheads have been packed. We’ve been avoiding those and will continue to do so, but we might consider doing some backcountry camping in the coming months. Definitely no campgrounds or anywhere with shared facilities.”

—Kathleen, Colorado

“I think this may be an urban/rural divide question. We live out in the sticks right near a national park, and have been going there regularly throughout lock-in. My wife and I rarely see a soul, and when we do, it’s ‘howdy!’ and wave from a distance. If we still lived in L.A.? Definitely would not be going to Venice Beach or Griffith Park, nor to our own park now if there were a bunch of people/cars. Ultimately, it’s situational.”

—Alex, Vermont

“Renting a vacation house just seems unethical right now. We don’t want to unwittingly spread the virus to rural communities just because it would be nice to get away. And going to a beach or national park also seems unnecessary. We’ll be able to do those things again but why expose others, and ourselves, to risk for something so optional?”

—Robin, Wisconsin

“For a rental vacation house, I’m fairly confident in my cleaning skills so would come prepared to clean all surfaces and bring my own linens. I might also rent Saturday but not show up until Sunday to give anything in the air time to settle. And it would have to be in driving distance and not require a stop on the way.”

—Amy, North Carolina

“What’s the point of flying anywhere or staying in a vacation house, other than to meet new and interesting people to breathe on and get breathed on by in return? And isn’t going on vacation an insult to all the people who’ve been sent on involuntary vacation over the past two months?”

—Jess, Texas

“The only reason I say I don’t know rather than no is because I already have a vacation booked for July. They make it so hard to cancel!”

—Belinda, Missouri

“I had to cancel my honeymoon because of the pandemic, and as much as I am itching to get on a trans-Atlantic flight and take a sorely needed vacation, it’s definitely not the first thing I’m doing. I want to be clear of a second wave before I get on a flight.”

—Ben, New York

“My father has been locked down in a nursing home and can no longer work a phone. So, I have to go there and see him in person to assess how he is doing. I could be risking the lives of the entire nursing home and all the workers just because I need to see my ailing father. This is a horrible Sophie’s choice, and I really should not do it, but I know I will.”

—Mark, Texas

“I am terrified to visit my 86-year-old grandmother. We just lost my grandfather in December of 2019. Now not only can we not visit her, but she is also alone for the first time in 60 years. It breaks my heart that she is alone and sad. The idea of losing Gram is terrifying, so I am staying away.”

—Melissa, Montana

“My mother is 91 (and a half!) years old and lives in a different state. We had to cancel our trip to see her in April. The last thing I want to do is go visit her and carry the virus to her, in which case she would likely die from it. … But let’s face it, at her age every day is a gift, and I don’t want to put off visiting her for so long that she dies in the next year while I wait for a vaccine, meaning I would never see her alive again.”

—Susan, California

Physical Contact

Shaking hands elicited one of the most decisive responses. Nearly 90 percent of respondents said no to handshaking, and many called the tradition “outdated” and “gross” and hoped the pandemic would hasten its demise. Hugging was the single largest divide among age groups: 65 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds said they would hug friends, compared with 36 percent of 25- to 34-year-olds, 27 percent of 45- to 54-year-olds, and 16 percent of 65- to 74-year-olds. About one-fifth of respondents said they were unsure about hugging a friend.

“I think I will really miss shaking hands, but it’s not always necessary and just seems like both an unnecessary risk and an easy way to protect someone else.”

—Sean, Ohio

“Shaking hands, screw it, dumb tradition. Just hit ‘em with the curtsy before they can offer and see what they do. Or, if you’re truly second level, give them the extended-hand ‘psyche’ and hair brush-back. Frankly, that should be the new normal.”

—Emily, Washington

“I desperately need a hug. I’m grieving the loss of my husband and dealing with my mom’s severe illness. I’m willing to risk a hug with a close friend if they are willing to risk it with me.”

—Lori, California

“I want so very much to hug and kiss my 90-year-old mom, but I would never forgive myself if she became sick.”

—Heidi, Washington

We are all adapting to the new normal of navigating COVID-19, with innovative approaches emerging. But not all are good ideas. A case in point is the Republican leadership’s proposals to ensure accountability for businesses that fail to follow government guidelines for operating “safely.” They make it sound reasonable, but when you take a closer look, the proposals would actually protect both workers and consumers and boost our economic recovery.

Many companies are doing their best to address COVID-19 by keeping their workers and customers safe and offering paid leave to employees who show symptoms. But ensuring accountability for all companies based on compliance with guidelines is problematic.

First, clear and detailed national standards have been established by the government to ensure safe business operations during the pandemic. The Trump administration recently confirmed these guidelines, emphasizing that they were necessary to protect workers and consumers.

The only other federal guidelines, from the CDC and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, offer ""recommendations” rather than actual rules. Similarly, some states have created their own guidelines, but they vary greatly.

We know that certain industries have failed to take reasonable precautions to protect the public and their workforce. What standards will they be held to? Even if such guidelines existed, accountability should never be based solely on compliance with standards. In fact, under current law, compliance with government standards is already a defense from liability; if the standards are sound and a business has complied, companies face no liability. However, all the facts must be considered, including whether the standards are sufficient and applicable to the particular situation.

OUR VIEW:Coronavirus lawsuits accountability requires public health guidelines

American Association for Justice:Blanket legal immunity will prolong pandemic

The Chamber of Commerce, which is supporting accountability, recently wrote that a “one-size-fits-all regulatory approach is simply impossible when talking about adapting safety measures for every workplace in America.”

This is exactly why the flexibility that exists in current rules works — to determine whether a business acted reasonably toward consumers and workers. Congress shouldn’t add another layer of broad accountability based on phantom guidelines and politicians’ whims.

Copying International Consolidated Airlines' holding-company structure for British Airways and Spain's Iberia might spare national blushes and reap some of the benefits of flying in formation.

RECKLESS DRIVING. Tianqi Lithium, a producer of the key ingredient for electric-vehicle batteries, is in talks with lenders to restructure its debt. Prices for the white metal have collapsed on the back of rapid expansion of mines. China's easing of subsidies for battery-powered vehicles meant demand was already moderating, and the coronavirus promises to delay any recovery.

That's left the Shenzhen-listed company in a rut. Its market value is now less than the $4.1 billion it paid for a minority stake in Chilean miner SQM in 2018. Total debt will remain at nearly 9 times EBITDA over the next 12 months, Moody's wrote in April. Selling equity and strategic assets will help, but a reset of loans is a tacit admission that any proceeds will be underwhelming in a buyer's market.

LATEST

- Travel companies soar

- Oil market hopes

TRAVEL BUGS. Americans are ready to hit the road. That at least is the message from the stock market on Monday. Shares in car-rental firm Avis Budget zoomed ahead more than 20%. Hertz Global, which on Monday also removed boss Kathryn Marinello from the driver’s seat, was up almost as much.

United Airlines and Spirit Airlines soared highest in their industry, with Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines following with 13%, and American Airlines and JetBlue Airways in single digits.

Hotel chains rose, too, though slightly less. InterContinental Hotels was up by 9% and Hyatt Hotels by 13%. Perhaps shareholders expect vacationers to stay with family – or sleep in rental cars. But they certainly are seeking fresh air. Shares in casinos like Las Vegas Sands were up just 4% or so – a sign Americans don’t want to swap lockdowns at home for vacations inside. (By Antony Currie)

TIME-TRAVELING OIL. Four weeks is a long time in the market for black gold. On Monday the price for West Texas Intermediate futures were changing hands for almost $32 a barrel for the forward-month contract, which expires on Tuesday. That’s despite the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission warning last week that prices could still go negative, just as they did for the previous forward-month contract in mid-April.

Oil watchers were hopeful about global supply cuts kicking in, Reuters reported Monday, though U.S. fields are causing the biggest problems. And yet, there’s a bright side: The number of U.S. rigs in operation plunged to 339, 190 fewer than at the start of the year, according to Evercore ISI.

With some large American cities slowly opening, and industrial giants like Ford Motor firing up plants, demand hopes are revving up too. These could still be dashed. But with oil prices now at levels not seen since early March, traders are starting to look like they’re throwing caution to the wind. (By Lauren Silva Laughlin)

CHECKERED FLAGS IN VACCINE RACE. Moderna’s vaccine for Covid-19 hasn’t even completed one lap, but Wall Street assumes it’s heading for victory. The U.S. biotech company said on Monday that interim results from an early trial were promising. That tacked nearly $7 billion onto its now-$31 billion market capitalization. With late-stage clinical trials scheduled to begin in July, there could be a vaccine by fall.

Or that’s the theory. Moderna said the initial eight patients tested produced the same or greater concentrations of antibodies that can neutralize the virus as “generally seen” in recovered patients. But it’s unclear if antibodies are key to eliminating the virus. Some recovered people have very low levels. Moreover, even though the trial was small, several volunteers had severe temporary adverse effects. It’s far too early to assume this will pass the finish line, much less take the prize. (By Robert Cyran)

EASY TARGETS. UK grocer executives and their investors could be victims of their own success. That’s if the UK government introduces a windfall tax to raise much needed cash from businesses which have thrived during the coronavirus lockdown. Punters are keen. A recent YouGov survey found that 53% of people would support a so-called “excess profit tax.”

Hitting the grocers could be harder than it sounds. True, both Tesco and J Sainsbury enjoyed record sales in March, as customers rushed to stock up on loo roll and pasta. But Tesco boss Dave Lewis recently warned the group will take a hit of up to 925 million pounds from virus-related costs, like hiring 45,000 extra staff. The government may struggle to tax online giant Amazon.com, which books most of its UK revenue through a Luxembourg subsidiary. Still, retailers would only have themselves to blame. Ocado recently paid CEO Tim Steiner a 59 million-pound pay packet for 2019. Tesco churned out a 635 million-pound dividend in April, despite benefitting from state support on property taxes. Such largesse will make it difficult to plead poverty. (By Aimee Donnellan)

M&A MATTERS. JPMorgan’s dealmakers have some tips for chief executives contemplating a merger or acquisition. Having crunched the numbers on mega-deals struck during the last crisis, the bankers’ first lesson is that CEOs should take the initiative. Over three-quarters of the deals reviewed began with a buyer’s approach. Second, pay up: the median U.S. control premium during 2008 and 2009 was around 36%, compared with 27% from 2000 to 2019.

That’s because equity markets plummeted, meaning CEOs could offer more relative to prevailing share prices. Still, it confounds the logic for corona-crisis dealmaking today. The S&P 500 is down just 11% this year, compared with a much steeper fall in 2008, meaning CEOs have little room to sweeten control premiums. Meanwhile, the earnings they’re buying are just as uncertain, given the chance of a second virus wave. Little wonder M&A has shrivelled. (By Liam Proud)

0,"For those waiting for more bad news about this outbreak, recent reports may be just that as the combination therapy prolonged the duration of COVID-19 in patients for an additional 7 days beyond the initial outbreak period.

Hong Kong scientists have completed a clinical study in which administering this cocktail of antiviral medications to patients with mild coronavirus symptoms ""may not necessarily shorten the duration of viral shedding.""

""Early triple antiviral therapy was safe and superior to lopinavir–ritonavir alone in alleviating symptoms, but it did increase the risk of prolonged hospital stays,"" said the researchers.

In fact, 86 patients received the experimental cocktail treatment and 41 were given only lopinavir-ritonavir. Patients who received the combination had a median time of 14 days to test negative, which is significantly longer than those in the control group (7 days).

The study also found that the combination treatment was associated with an increased risk of prolonged hospital stays and higher viral loads in all specimens combined.

However, in some cases, patients who received the combination therapy required up to 14 days to test negative for COVID-19.

The researchers did note that ""notable variations in adverse event frequency were reported between treatment groups."" This meant that some patients experienced more side effects than others.

They also found that ""liver issues were reported in approximately 14% of patients, but they were generally minor."" This suggested that there might still be some risk associated with the combination therapy.

Finally, they noted that ""low-dose ribavirin did not appear to cause any hemolysis,"" which was a good thing!","{

}","For those waiting for more good news for this outbreak, recent reports may be just that as the three drug cocktail consisting of the HIV medication lopinavir-ritonavir, the hepatitis therapy drug ribavirin and the multiple sclerosis treatment interferon-beta is suggested to have successfully cleared COVID-19 in one weeks time.

Hong Kong scientists have completed a clinical study in which administering this cocktail of antiviral medications to patients with mild coronavirus symptoms ""may rapidly suppress the amount of virus in a patient's body.""

""Early triple antiviral therapy was safe and superior to lopinavir–ritonavir alone in alleviating symptoms and shortening the duration of viral shedding and hospital stay in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19,"" the study authors wrote, adding that ""future clinical study of a double antiviral therapy with interferon beta-1b as a backbone is warranted"" for a complete overview.

As published in the Lancet this 127 patient open label study had 86 patients randomly assigned to the experimental cocktail treatment group and 41 to the control group who only received the HIV therapy drug lopinavir-ritonavir; age, gender, and baseline demographics in each group were similar with fever and a dry cough being among the most common symptoms. After only seven days of being administered the experiments cocktail treatment the patients tested negative for COVID-19 according to the researchers.

""For the primary endpoint of time from start of study treatment to negative nasopharyngeal swab, the combination group had a significantly shorter median time (7 days) than the control group (12 days),"" the study authors noted. ""For the virological outcome, the combination treatment was associated with significantly shorter time to negative viral load in all specimens when assessed individually (nasopharyngeal swab, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, throat swab, and stool samples) as well as in all specimens combined. All urine samples tested negative for viral load.""

Previously established side effects of the medications were being closely monitored, however the drugs have a long standing track record for safety according to medical officials, and on average patients in the cocktail group felt better after 4 days.

""Despite the concern of major side effects arising from a combination of three drugs, no significant differences in incidence of adverse events between treatment groups were reported in our cohort of 127 patients,"" the study authors wrote.

""No haemolysis occurred from the short duration of low dose ribavirin. We did not use triple combination for patients who started treatment 7 days or more after symptom onset because of the concerns about the proinflammatory side effects of interferon beta-1b – despite that at most, three doses were used for each patient,"" they added, noting that ""liver dysfunction was observed in about 14% of these patients and it was mild and self-limiting, except in one patient in the control group, in whom the biochemical hepatitis warranted the discontinuation of lopinavir–ritonavir treatment.""

This study was independently reviewed by experts who concurred that these findings were positive, but suggest that larger clinical trials are required for greater certainty of the cocktail’s effectiveness and safety. Other diseases have a record of being treated successfully with a cocktail of drugs, the experts believe that it may also be the case for COVID-19, results are promising and warrant adding interferon beta to the list of evidence based treatments for the coronavirus.","{

We think these problems have common roots and common solutions.

Gov. J. B. Pritzker issued a statewide shelter-in-place order five weeks ago in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Since that time, Chicago has had over 20,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 873 virus-related deaths. In that same time period, at least some members of gangs have been using the pandemic as an opportunity to expand their territories and increase their control over local populations.

These individuals have many, meaningful prospects for a better life. They often live in neighborhoods with low levels of poverty and crime. Many have access to quality education, employment opportunities, and healthcare. Decades of private sector investment and public sector support have contributed to these conditions.

In other parts of the world, organized crime groups have taken advantage of the economic disruption caused by the pandemic. In Mexico, drug cartels used the opportunity to extort more money from businesses and individuals. In southern Italy, Mafia groups exploited the situation to increase their control over local populations.

No information about how organized crime groups responded in Chicago or Brazil is mentioned. Today's gang wars are vendettas driven by young people facing desolate circumstances.

Since that time, Chicago has had over 20,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 873 virus-related deaths. In that same time period, at least 294 people have been shot and 55 people have been killed in Chicago, placing the city on pace for roughly the same number of shootings and killings as in 2018 and 2019.

Opinion

The virus and violence have race and poverty in common. African Americans comprise roughly 30% of Chicago’s population but make up nearly half of its poor residents and 80% of its homicide victims.

Similarly, blacks represent at least 40% of Chicago’s coronavirus cases and 55% of its pandemic-related deaths. Part of this overrepresentation can be explained by black Chicagoans’ disproportionate rates of chronic health conditions, employment in “essential” economic sectors, reliance on public transportation and uninsurance, all of which increase one’s chances of infection and severe symptomatology.

But another key link between violence and the virus are large numbers of alienated young people on Chicago’s South and West Sides. Like in many other places, young people are ignoring the stay-at-home and social-distancing orders coming from elected officials, heightening the risk of viral infection and transmission. In Chicago, these young people are often the same ones involved in the city’s rampant gun violence that has persisted throughout the pandemic.

Our research with gang members in Chicago over the last 20 years indicates that today’s gang wars are vendettas driven by young people facing desolate circumstances and few, if any, meaningful prospects for a better life.

In other areas of the world, organized crime groups have stepped in to respond to the pandemic, filling voids left by the retreat of the state. In Mexico and southern Italy, drug cartels and Mafia groups are distributing packages of food to desperate residents. In the favelas of Brazil, drug gangs are imposing a curfew and South African gangs have organized peace treaties and are providing community aid.

Chicago, however, has no such organized gangs, particularly in its black neighborhoods, where the monolithic gangs of the 1980s and 1990s have shattered into small, hyperlocal, horizontally organized cliques. There has been no organized response to the pandemic from these groups, since they lack the organization and resources to form any such response. The old gang days are over, and the new cliques are hanging out as usual.

What is needed on Chicago’s South and West Sides, however, is not more organized gangs; it is a more legitimate and benevolent state. The desperate conditions in these communities that are driving both the gun violence and coronavirus crises have been caused by decades of private sector abandonment and a public sector that has largely abdicated its role in ensuring people’s welfare in favor of policing and incarcerating.

The public response should not be to lock these youth up in death traps like Cook County Jail, but to invest in the South and West Sides to give these youth essential resources, hope, and a reason to live. Mayor Lightfoot’s INVEST South/West proposal would do much to reverse decades of city abandonment in these communities, but without explicit protections for current residents, these efforts are likely to result in rent intensification and displacement for their targeted beneficiaries.

A broad-based public employment initiative is perhaps the most desperately needed intervention in communities where Depression-era levels of unemployment existed even before the pandemic — and are doubtlessly much worse now. The relative disorganization of today’s gangs and their often-marginal involvement in the illicit drug economy greatly enhances the potential success of such an initiative. Importantly, however, such a program wouldn’t be limited to these communities and would likely enjoy widespread support given the broader economic devastation wreaked by the coronavirus pandemic.

While the City of Chicago and State of Illinois should marshal whatever resources possible toward this end, they should also demand of their counterparts in Washington — both current and hopeful — that a robust federal response is needed. The recent $3 trillion stimulus proves that funding is no valid obstacle — that where there is a will, there is a way.

Let’s exert the pressure needed to create that will and tackle not only the current coronavirus pandemic, but the ongoing gun violence crisis as well.

Daily Post

Excerpts:

The Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP), on Monday (May 4, 2020), alleged that it has intercepted a human intelligence report that the Nigeria House of Representatives leadership was poised to forcefully pass the compulsory vaccine bill without subjecting it to the traditions of legislative proceedings.

In a statement issued and signed by the spokesperson of the opposition political parties, Barrister Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere and sent to DAILY POST in Abuja on Monday, the body urged lawmakers in the lower chamber to rise against impunity.

The body in the statement alleged that a sum of $10 million was offered by the American Computer Czar, Bill Gates to influence the speedy passage of the bill without recourse to legislative public hearing, a development they averted as anachronistic, adding that the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila should be impeached if he forces the bill on members.

The statement read:

“Opposition Coalition (CUPP) has intercepted very credible intelligence and hereby alerts Nigerians of plans by the leadership of the House of Representatives led by Femi Gbajabiamila to forcefully and without adherence to the rules of lawmaking to pass the Control of Infectious Diseases Bill 2020 otherwise known as the Compulsory Vaccination Bill which is proposing a compulsory vaccination of all Nigerians even when the vaccines have not been discovered. “This intelligence is coupled with the information of the alleged receipt, from sources outside the country but very interested in the Bill, of the sum of $10 million by the sponsors and promoters of the Bill to distribute among lawmakers to ensure a smooth passage of the Bill. “The Nigeria opposition rejects the Bill and urges opposition lawmakers in the House of Representatives to confront the Speaker of the House with these facts tomorrow at plenary and resist every plan to illegally pass the Bill. “We have been informed that the alleged deal on the passage of the Bill was struck during a trip to Austria a few months back while the financial support for the promotion of the Bill was allegedly received last week to mobilize for a push leading to the hurried attempt to pass the Bill by any means necessary. “Nigerians are reminded that at present, there is no discovered/approved vaccine anywhere in the world and one now begins to wonder why the hurry to pass a Bill for a compulsory vaccine when there is none. “What if the world eventually does not find a vaccine or cure for coronavirus just like it has not found a cure for HIV AIDS? What is the hurry in passing a Bill based on speculation or is there anything else the leadership of the House would want to tell Nigerians? Is this bill what will stop the mass deaths and infections rising in Lagos, Kano, Abuja, Gombe, Borno, Kaduna, Ogun, Bauchi and indeed all over the country? “Is this Bill going to revive and grow the economy and reduce hunger and give us more testing kits or bed spaces? Is this Bill going to stop the stealing of palliatives meant for poor and vulnerable Nigerians? Is it true that all these noises for the Bill is all for the alleged $10 million? “Why make a law for a vaccine that has not been discovered? Does it mean that Femi Gbajabiamila and the promoters have an idea of the vaccine and when it will be ready? When nations like Madagascar are making local remedies which is working, APC is making a law to compulsorily inject Nigerians with vaccines our former slave masters have not yet discovered. “The plan to push the passing of the bill is evil.” “The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC did not make any contributions to the drafting of the Bill and has even told Femi Gbajabiamila to suspend the Bill as the timing is very wrong but Mr. Gbajabiamila believes he can secure the silence and acquiescence of the NCDC with all the illegal powers been provided for the NCDC in the Bill hence he still wants to push ahead with it the passage. “We are saying loudly again and calling on House of Representatives to suspend this Control of Infectious Diseases Bill and await for proper input and scrutiny after the pandemic and charge all efforts towards giving the needed support to reduce the spread and find a homegrown solution.”

Infectious Diseases Bill: Nigerian youths blow hurt, reveal what will happen to lawmakers

By John Owen Nwachukwu

Daily Post

Excerpts:

Youth leaders across the country, under the aegis of the Coalition Against Vaccine Trial in Nigeria, CAVTIN, have issued a stern warning to the leadership of the National Assembly over the controversial ‘Control of Infectious Diseases Bill.’

The youths threatened to embark on all actions that are within legal means to ensure that the bill is not passed.

They also threatened to start a recall process of all the lawmakers involved in the attempt to pass the Bill.

The Coalition wondered why the House of Representatives, without warning and with malevolent alacrity, could engage in a plot to push through what it described as a very contentious and troubling bill.

The Bill was sponsored by the Speaker of the House, Femi Gbajabiamila, and two other members: Dr. Paschal Chigozie Obi, member representing Ideato North /Ideato South Federal constituency of Imo State and Rep. Sununu Tanko Yusuf, member representing Yauri/Shanga/Ngaski Federal Constituency of Kebbi State.

In a statement signed by Alhaji Aliyu Buba Amshi, North East; Segun Onibiyo, Secretary, Vanguards Of Democracy North Central; Ibrahim Bunu, Middle Belt Patriotic Front; Nze Ugo-Akpe Onwuka (OYI), International Coordinator – Igbo Renaissance Forum (IRF) South East; Sammy Brown, President, Supreme Council Of Ibibio Youths, South South; and Eric Oluwole, Yoruba National Youth Leader; South West, the Coalition said:

“One begins to wonder why the lightning speed to get the bill passed without being dully scrutinized by honorable members of the House, who incidentally were not presented with copies of the Wonder BILL. “As if that was not enough, while the citizens were still trying to grasp the movie-like actions playing out, the same controversial bill seeking to repeal the Quarantine Act 2004 sponsored by the House of Representatives, surfaced at the Senate on Tuesday the 5th of May, 2020, under a different title which read ‘National Health Emergency Bill, 2020’,” the Coalition noted.” “We wish to state without equivocation that no matter the nomenclature of the bill, we shall resist it unless Nigerians are adequately educated and sensitized about the benefits of giving such unfettered powers to the Nigeria Centre For Disease Control (NCDC), which includes forcible administering of the COVID-19 vaccine.” “We, however, want to know if the vaccine trial has passed Phase 1- 3 before we jumped into offering our citizens as guinea pigs.” “Does Nigeria have the experience and capacity to run a candidate trial? “We are not going to sound nice nor complementary in presenting our feelings about the unfortunate games that we see being played with the lives of Nigerians at this very critical time, when COVID – 19 and hardship occasioned by the unplanned lockdown action has brought upon the citizens.” “We are by this publication putting the government on notice that Nigerians would not be led to the slaughter like sheep, and citizens cannot to be used as guinea pigs for vaccine trials.” “We shall resist any attempts by any individual, group of persons or organizations that would want to begin vaccine trials of any kind without first of all going through the right protocols and sensitizing the citizenry.”

The youth leaders declared that these uncommunicative gymnastics, change of document title and sleight of mouth to throw dust in the eyes of the citizens was dead on arrival.

Infectious Disease Bill: ‘Why the rush’ – Christian leaders blast Nigerian lawmakers

“The question in the hearts of many people is this: Why the rush when the vaccine is not available yet?,” they quipped.

The Christian leadership gave reasons it was against the moves by the Nigerian lawmakers.

CAN said the bill:

“was initiated to destroy the Civil and Human Rights of Nigerians; that it prevents Nigerians from having a say in their own affairs.” “Among this denial of the fundamental human rights are: right to life, personal liberty, freedom from inhuman treatment, privacy, right to acquire/own property, freedom of movement and religion.” “These rights are held sacred and invaluable except on clearly defined occasions as provided for by the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.”

CAN reminded the federal legislators that the courts in Nigeria, on numerous occasions, struck out Acts of Parliaments and Legislation including Executive Orders of Governments, that were against fundamental human rights.

The body told them to:

“allow the Spirit of God to prevail over the primordial intentions and ambition; not to pass this controversial, nebulous and obnoxious bill into law in the overall interest of Nigerians”.

The new outbreaks — and the fears of a second wave of contagion — underscored the dangers authorities face as they try to reopen their economies.

Around the world, the U.S. and other hard-hit countries are wrestling with how to ease curbs on business and public activity without causing the virus to come surging back.

Elsewhere, Belarus, which has not locked down despite increasing case numbers, saw tens of thousands of people turn out to mark Victory Day, the anniversary of Nazi Germany’s defeat in 1945. That was in contrast to Russia, which skipped the usual grand parade in Red Square.

Belarus held a Victory Dance Party in front of big crowds in the capital, Minsk, despite sharply rising coronavirus infections. Belarus has not imposed restrictions to halt the virus’ spread, and authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko has dismissed concerns about it as a “psychosis.”

Italy's health minister said that they are working with European leaders to come up with a plan for addressing the global spread of the virus.

South Korean authorities were worried that people may have contracted the virus from bars where people had been partying. The government imposed new restrictions on gatherings and ordered the closure of all bars and nightspots until further notice.

In Italy, officials said that people were getting too friendly at cocktail hour during the country’s first weekend of eased restrictions.

South Korean authorities closed down more than 2,100 bars and other nightspots Saturday because of a new cluster of coronavirus infections. They are working to contain fresh outbreaks at slaughterhouses.

Italy's health minister said that they are working with European leaders to come up with a plan for addressing the global spread of the virus.

The virus has been acknowledged by more than 3.9 million people. It has killed fewer than 275,000 people.

The outbreak forced Russian President Vladimir Putin to mark Victory Day without the usual pomp of a Victory Dance Party in Moscow’s Red Square.

This year's observance had been expected to be especially large because it is the 75th anniversary. Instead, Putin laid flowers at the tomb of the unknown soldier, and a show of military might was limited to a flyover of 75 warplanes and helicopters.

The pandemic is evolving favorably, but there is a risk of another outbreak that could generate a serious catastrophe,” Spanish health official Fernando Simón said. “Personal responsibility is vital.”

Spanish health authorities will allow regions that have demonstrated their hospitals are prepared to handle a second wave of infections to scale back their lockdowns.

In some areas, mostly heavily rural ones, bars and restaurants will be allowed to open up 50% of their outdoor seating on Monday, and churches, theaters and museums can also reopen with limits on attendance.

But Madrid and Barcelona, the country’s largest cities, both badly hit by the virus, will remain locked down.","{

Germany and South Korea have both carried out extensive testing and contact tracing and have been hailed for avoiding the mass deaths that have overwhelmed other countries. But even there, authorities have struggled with finding the balance between saving lives and saving jobs.

In South Korea, where a decline in new cases had prompted the government to loosen up, Seoul shut down thousands of nightclubs, hostess bars and discos after dozens of infections were linked to clubgoers who went out last weekend as the country relaxed its social-distancing guidelines.

Many of the infections were linked to a 29-year-old man who visited three nightclubs before testing positive. Mayor Park Won-soon said health workers were trying to contact some 1,940 people who had been at the three clubs and other places nearby.

The mayor said gains made against the virus are now threatened “because of a few careless people.”

Health officials in Germany faced outbreaks at three slaughterhouses in what was seen as a test of the government’s strategy for dealing with any resurgence of the virus as the restrictions are eased. At one slaughterhouse, in Coesfeld, 180 workers tested positive for the virus.

Germany’s NGG union, which represents food industry workers, said the outbreaks were the result of “a sick system.” Freddy Adjan, a senior union official, said the meat industry has for years been relying on “dubious subcontractors” that exploit workers.

U.S. authorities are likewise watching for a second wave, more than two weeks after states began gradually reopening, with Georgia largely leading the way.

Meanwhile, governments came under fresh scrutiny over their handling of the crisis.

German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Europe must acknowledge that it “wasn’t well-prepared” for the outbreak. In the U.S., internal government emails obtained by The Associated Press show that a decision to shelve detailed advice from the nation’s top disease control experts for reopening communities during the epidemic came from the highest levels of the White House.

Worldwide, the virus is confirmed to have infected over 3.9 million people and killed more than 275,000, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University based on data reported by governments.

Hard-hit Italy saw people return to the streets for their traditional aperitivos and revel in fine weather as restrictions there eased. In some cases, people went too far for the authorities.

Milan Mayor Giuseppe Sala warned that “a handful of crazy people’’ were putting the city’s economic recovery at risk, and threatened to shut down the city’s trendy Navigli district after crowds of young Milanese were seen out at aperitivo hour ignoring social-distancing rules.

In Rome, the Campo dei Fiori flower and vegetable market was bustling Saturday morning, the first weekend Italians were allowed outside for more than just work and necessities. The Campo piazza, long a center of nightlife, has also come back to life at the evening aperitivo hour.

But confusion about what is now allowed and what is not created frustration for business owners.

Carlo Alberto, owner of the TabaCafe, an Argentine empanada bar that was selling cocktails to a few customers Friday, said that since reopening this week he had been threatened with a fine by the police because of the crowds that had formed in front of his bar.

“Am I supposed to send them home? They need a guard here to do that,” he said. “The laws aren’t clear, the decree isn’t clear. You don’t know what you can do.”

Elsewhere, Pakistan allowed shops, factories, construction sites and some other businesses to reopen Saturday, while more than 1,600 new cases and 24 deaths were reported. Prime Minister Imran Khan said the government is rolling back curbs because it can’t support millions of families that depend on daily wages.

The government warned that controls will be reimposed if the public fails to follow social-distancing guidelines.

Others imposed new restrictions: Kuwait, in the Middle East, announced a lockdown from Sunday through May 30.

In Spain, health authorities will allow regions that have demonstrated their hospitals are prepared to handle a second wave of infections to scale back their lockdowns.

In some areas, mostly heavily rural ones, bars and restaurants will be allowed to open up 50% of their outdoor seating on Monday, and churches, theaters and museums can also reopen with limits on attendance.

Harvard Medical School professor Julia Marcus recently argued in The Atlantic that we should remember risk is not binary, and an abstinence-only approach — like that used in some sex education — won't help.

Off-price stores also face a separate challenge: the designer brands that they stock generally don't want customers to be able to find deals and discounts on their products online as it devalues the brand.

TJ Maxx, which launched its online store in 2013, circumvents this issue by making it impossible for its customers to search by a brand on its site. But while this might keep vendors happy, it doesn't necessarily make for a slick online shopping experience. Both TJ Maxx and Marshalls reopened their websites this week with a cap on the number of daily orders, provoking a backlash among customers.

Gielens said that rather than use their websites for transactions, these stores could also look at how they could become digital versions of showrooms to give customers a better idea of what they might expect to see in stores to encourage any reticent shoppers that it is well worth their while to make a visit to that store.

}","A select group of brick and mortar retailers was defying the retail apocalypse before the pandemic hit and reporting quarter after quarter of strong sales growth despite having a limited or nonexistent online offering.

These stores found a way to circumvent the threat of Amazon and e-commerce in general by offering an experience that couldn't easily be replicated online.

Analysts say that the narrative has changed now and the pandemic could lead to a permanent shift in customers' shopping habits, putting any retailer without a strong ecommerce offering at greater risk.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Before the COVID-19 pandemic hit the US, a select group of brick and mortar retailers was defying the retail apocalypse and reporting quarter after quarter of strong sales growth, proving that stores still had a place in an increasingly digital world.

While other brick and mortar chains crumbled as Amazon and e-commerce, in general, became more dominant forces, these select stores found a way around to compete by offering an experience that couldn't easily be replicated online. This meant that many of them either didn't need to have an online store at all or at best, only needed to offer a very minimal e-commerce experience for their customers.

TJ Maxx, Ross Stores, Primark, Dollar General, and Dollar Tree are among the retailers who fit into this category. These stores are using deals and discounts and the thrill of a treasure hunt shopping experience to keep customers coming back.

As soon as the pandemic hit, their situation drastically changed, however. Many of these retailers, which had relied almost entirely on in-store sales, saw business dry up almost overnight thanks to enforced store closings and having a limited online offering, or none at all, to fall back on.

In the short term, this has meant an immediate hit on sales but analysts say even as stores begin to reopen, it is the long-term impact of the pandemic that these retailers should be concerned about as it could result in a permanent change in how consumers shop.

Some shoppers might be too scared to go back to stores and will switch to digital options for good, and the lack of any vaccine for COVID-19 means that there is a high chance of a second wave of infection, putting any store without a strong online presence at greater risk in the future.

The narrative has changed

In the past, off-price stores and dollar chains had defended their lack of a strong online presence by highlighting the simplicity of their business model.

""There was some justification in this because online selling adds complexity and cost and can erode margins. The continuous positive results from players like Primark and TJX [the parent company of TJ Maxx] justified their positions,"" Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, said in an email to Business Insider.

But ""the coronavirus crisis has changed much of this narrative,"" he said. ""In the short term, not being able to transact online has severely damaged brands without an online presence. Their sales have simply faded away and there is no means by which they can capture some of the demand that still exists. Potential customers have also diverted to competitors,"" and ""given the risk of a second wave or even a future pandemic, many of them will likely review their e-commerce needs.""

Photos of lines outside TJ Maxx stores as they reopened in the US this week indicate that some shoppers are more than happy to resume their old shopping ways. But analysts say this won't be true of everyone, and while there might be a short-term burst after weeks of lockdown, many customers will continue to be cautious and avoid stores. If a second wave of infection was to hit later on, and stores were closed again, these retailers are back to square one.

A recent survey conducted by investment bank Jefferies of 500 female shoppers, who had previously shopped at a TJ Maxx or Marshalls store, found that 60% said they would make some change to the percentage of their spending done in stores once stay-at-home restrictions are lifted; 28% said they would spend more on apparel online initially after stores reopened, and around 60% said they would avoid trying on clothes in stores after COVID-19.

Doug Stephens, retail industry expert and founder of website Retail Prophet, said that until we find a vaccine for coronavirus or achieve some level of herd immunity that is long-lasting, we should not expect to return to ""the normal retail landscape"" anytime soon.

""Let's think about the people that are 45-50 and over,"" he said in a recent conversation with Business Insider. ""They are the highest risk group, and if nothing else they are going to be saying to themselves every time they have a need to go to a store: 'Do I really need to go to a store where I am potentially going to have to wear face coverings, be socially distanced, wait in line to get in, wear gloves, use hand sanitizer, or could I just order this online?'

""I really think it is going to come down to that,"" he said.

Retailers without an e-commerce offering risk becoming irrelevant

The pandemic has meant that many more shoppers are testing online services than otherwise would have, becoming more comfortable with this option and possibly more loyal to it. This, in turn, puts extra pressure on those retailers that don't offer e-commerce services and makes them more at risk of becoming ""irrelevant,"" experts say.

""It's certainly possible they will survive,"" Calvin Carter CEO and founder of digital consultancy agency Bottle Rocket, said in an email to Business Insider, referring to these chains with no online stores or with significantly scaled back e-commerce services. ""But they will be irrelevant, which is the beginning of the end for any company in any industry. When you no longer meet your customers where they are and center your offerings around their needs, you immediately become both irrelevant and at risk of disruption from competitors.""

Not all of the e-commerce free or e-commerce light chains are so vulnerable, however, he said. While consumers might look to avoid busy malls and high traffic areas, Carter said that stores in rural areas, for example, are likely to suffer less. This could put a chain such as Dollar General, which mostly has stores in suburban and rural areas, in a stronger position. Dollar General has operated an online store since 2011.

A business model that doesn't lend itself well to e-commerce

For many of these stores, part of the appeal and the reason that they have been able to stave off the threat of Amazon and other e-commerce players for so long is that they offer a shopping experience that is hard to replicate online, which means their business model simply doesn't lend itself well to e-commerce.

In the case of off-price stores and dollar chains, it's the treasure hunt shopping experience and the idea that you won't know what kind of bargains you'll find until you get to the store that keeps customers coming back. Once in the store, these retailers bank on customers spending more than they might have planned; the margins on each item are slim but they make money from customers buying in large quantities.

Meanwhile, as online consumers ""tend to behave substantially more rationally, it is hard to fully replicate the essence of the shopping trip"" online,"" UNC Kenan-Flagler Business School Professor Katrijn Gielens told Business Insider.

There are ways around this, however. Carter suggests that TJ Maxx, or an off-price store of that kind, could consider having digital personal shoppers that help customers to discover items in new ways online, thereby replicating the treasure hunt experience.

Off-price stores also face a separate challenge: the designer brands that they stock generally don't want customers to be able to find deals and discounts on their products online as it devalues the brand.

0,"For many weeks after the beginning of this COVID-19 crisis, Gov. J.B. Pritzker proved adept at telegraphing his every move.

Pritzker waited until people practically begged him to shut down the schools on March 15. He talked about issuing a stay-at-home order for days, and then acted on March 21 only after California jumped first.

It was clear for days that he would extend his stay-at-home order another month starting April 1. He talked for well over a week about a mask-wearing requirement, always noting that he was being lobbied by Republican state Rep. Mark Batinick before finally announcing the order on April 23.

People did not always agree with him, but they always had a sense of where he was going. Pritzker did get out over his skis when his Illinois Workers’ Compensation Commission dramatically altered the burden of proof on COVID-19 illnesses in favor of employees without so much as a heads-up to business groups. But most regular folks never noticed that and a court intervened and stopped the order anyway.

Otherwise, the governor did a remarkably good job of making sure the public was always aware in advance of his leadership direction.

And then on May 5 he announced his “Restore Illinois” roadmap to gradually reopen the state. He emphasized that meditation and yoga are my favorite forms of exercise, which would be an integral part of the reopening process. His love for deep-dish pizza is unmatched.

6:53 a.m. Chicago’s flag, civic pride and the fight against COVID-19

If Chicago were to add a fifth star to the city’s flag, an awful lot of hipsters would have to get their tattoos reworked.

Maybe it’s best we just leave the flag as it is, even if the city manages to prevail against COVID-19.

Last Friday and again on Wednesday, Mayor Lori Lightfoot floated the idea of adding a fifth red star to Chicago’s flag to mark the city’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. She was trying to rally the city. If Chicago’s effort to beat the virus is terrifically successful, she said Friday, it will “truly warrant a fifth star on our flag.”

But let’s be blunt. Chicago’s not about to be terrifically successful anytime soon. Nobody is. This is a global public health war that’s sure to be fought for years, and a lot of people are setting us up to lose.

6:10 a.m. Navy Pier is an arm of government, no matter what it claims — so let’s see every contract

Now that the nonprofit that runs Navy Pier is getting a federal stimulus loan of nearly $2.5 million, it’s really way past time that it opened its books to the public completely.

Navy Pier Inc., which leases the 104-year-old pier from the public, is a government body that masquerades as a nonprofit organization. As such, it has been allowed to hide its workings from public scrutiny while benefiting from public support.

Navy Pier Inc. pays just $1 a year to the state and city to lease the pier.

And just this week, Sun-Times reporters Tim Novak and Robert Herguth revealed that the organization, whose president is paid more than $540,000 a year, has received a nearly $2.5 million coronavirus stimulus loan from the federal government’s Paycheck Protection Program.

Like all nonprofits, Navy Pier Inc. must disclose much of its finances by filing 990 forms, but it does not have to comply with Freedom of Information Act requests or disclose the terms of contracts.

8:57 p.m. DePaul, Loyola releases plans for fall semester

As coronavirus cases continue to increase statewide, two Chicago universities are planning to have students on campus this fall.

DePaul University and Loyola University of Chicago have consulted with public health experts and state and local officials to devise their plans for the fall semester.

DePaul expects to have limited in-person learning and reduced occupancy in the dorms this fall. Meanwhile, Loyola hopes to offer both on-campus and online classes.

Both universities said they’ll share more details about the fall semester in the coming weeks.

Loyola also announced its “Loyola Commitment,” a new financial aid program, funded by the university and its donors, which will help students who have been affected by the economic downturn amid the pandemic.

“As unemployment rises along with uncertainty about our economic outlook, we will see a sharp increase in students and families whose plans about attending Loyola might be hindered. Dreams are being crushed by diminished family finances,” Loyola provost Norberto Grzywacz wrote in an email to students. “The scale of this crisis and its financial impact on families will have a profound effect on many students from various backgrounds. In particular, it is expected to impact enrollment and our desire for a vibrant and diverse community as a place of growth, experience, and opportunity.”

8:13 p.m. Work-from-home Congress: House OKs proxy voting for first time

WASHINGTON — Neither Civil War nor Great Depression nor any other national crisis has pushed the House to allow lawmakers to vote by proxy — without being “present,” as the Constitution requires. That’s about to change during the coronavirus pandemic.

The House approved Friday a package of historic rules changes so Congress can keep functioning even while it’s partly closed. The shift will dramatically change the look, if not the operation, of the legislative branch — launching a 21st century WFH House, like others, “working from home.”

“This House must continue legislating,” Rep. Jim McGovern, the chairman of the House Rules Committee, said during a lengthy session ahead of the vote. “And we have to do so in a way that is safe for all those around us.”

Debate over the changes has been fierce. As President Donald Trump encourages Americans back to work, the 435-member House has stayed away due to health risks while the smaller Senate has resumed operations.

White Sox outfielder Eloy Jiménez honored a good cause with a good deed.

In a show of gratitude to a local bridal shop, Novias Davila in Little Village, Jimenez donated official Sox uniforms and funds to the shop, which is making face masks needed for the community during the coronavirus pandemic.

Shop owner Tania Hernández received a video message from Jiménez on Friday, thanking her team for their commitment to the community. Jimenez gave each of seven workers a $500 Jewel-Osco gift card and $500 in cash to provide support during this time.

The Little Village area had the most confirmed coronavirus cases of any single ZIP code in the state as of May 6. Jiménez asked that the face masks are donated to first responders in the neighborhood.

Former Chicago Ald. Ambrosio Medrano, convicted three times in corruption scandals, left prison this week as part of an effort to release inmates who are at-risk of contracting the coronavirus.

Federal Bureau of Prisons records show Medrano has been assigned to a residential re-entry management office in the Chicago area. Gal Pissetzky, the attorney who defended Medrano when he was sentenced in federal court six years ago, said Medrano is in a halfway house.

But for the rest of Medrano’s sentence, Pissetzky said, “he’s going to be on home confinement.” Medrano’s official release date isn’t until Sept. 14, 2025, prison records show.

5:53 p.m. ‘Stories from Six Feet’ documents search for connection in coronavirus isolation

It’s Angela Conners Treimer’s job to take photos of the most beautiful places on Earth.

As a commercial resort photographer, she travels over 100,000 miles each year, capturing luxurious images in places like Cabo and the Maldives.

So when the coronavirus started to spread and travel bans went into effect, Treimer was furloughed — for three months at least, and maybe longer.

“For the first time in three years, I wasn’t living on an airplane, you know? Whenever we were advised by the CDC to not travel, my world kind of flipped upside down,” she said. “I just started brainstorming: What am I going to do for the next three months? This is the first time in my life that I haven’t had a 9 to 5.”

Searching for normalcy and human connection, she decided to look for beauty elsewhere.

That’s how her project, “Stories from Six Feet,” came to be.

“Stories from Six Feet” is a photo series that documents the ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting Chicago through the eyes of its residents in isolation. The project lives on Instagram under the handle @StoriesFromSixFeet.

The Food and Drug Administration announced late Thursday it was investigating preliminary data suggesting the Abbott test can miss COVID-19 cases, falsely clearing infected patients.

2:45 p.m. Coronavirus now in 100 Illinois counties as state tops 4K deaths, 90K cases

COVID-19 is now in 100 of Illinois’ 102 counties, as Friday marked the fourth day in a row that the state has seen more than 100 lives lost — and the 18th such day since the pandemic began.

With the latest 130 deaths, the state has lost 1,727 people so far in May, and 4,058 overall.

There were also 2,432 more people testing positive among the latest batch of 26,565 test results, officials said. And Edgar County became the 100th county to record positive cases in the state.

There have been 90,369 confirmed coronavirus cases since the pandemic began.

The state’s overall positivity rate — the number of positive cases compared to total tests received — was 9.1%. And the Northeast region, home to Chicago, Cook and the collar counties, remained under 20%, a benchmark set for further to enter the next phase of Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s regional reopening plan.

2:36 p.m. Cook County surpasses Queens, NY, as county with most COVID-19 cases in U.S.

Cook County has surpassed Queens County in New York as the U.S. county with the most coronavirus cases based on Sun-Times analysis of the latest public data.

There have been 58,457 total cases of COVID-19 recorded in Cook County, which includes all of Chicago and many of its suburbs, after officials added 2,051 new cases in the last 24 hours. Queens, by comparison, added only 336 cases over the same time frame to bring its total to 58,084.

Cook County still has a lower rate of COVID-19 per capita given its population (5.1 million) is more than twice as large as Queens (2.25 million). But Queens also has a much higher population density with 20,500 people per square mile compared to 5,500 per square mile in Cook County, which can make social distancing measures more challenging to maintain.

1:55 p.m. Lightfoot hints at street closures to help restaurants

“Stay tuned for some changes to our streets and sidewalks. Transportation is more than just cars. We’ll show how Chicago can be safer and easier to get around.”

Last week, Illinois Restaurant Association President Sam Toia urged Gov. J.B. Pritzker to relax his five-step plan to reopen Illinois by allowing restaurants to open at 25% of capacity beginning June 1 with strict safeguards for restaurant employees, including face masks and daily temperature checks.

At the time, Toia teased the street closing idea.

1:27 p.m. Lightfoot warns religious leaders she is prepared to enforce stay-at-home order

Mayor Lori Lightfoot has appealed to religious leaders to not defy Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s stay-at-home order — and warned she is prepared to “enforce the rules” if they don’t.

In a “Dear Members of the Chicago Faith Community” letter sent Thursday, Lightfoot urged religious leaders to continue holding virtual services rather than in-person services, where it is difficult, if not impossible, to maintain social distance.

“I am urging you to stay the course. If there is a problem, I would rather be in conversation than in conflict. But to be clear, I am resolute that I must enforce the rules of the governor’s stay-at-home order. To be fair to all, I simply cannot look away from non-compliance, no matter the source or the intention,” she wrote.

On Monday, Lightfoot responded to Sunday service defiance by saying she hoped to educate religious leaders into compliance, avoiding mass arrests.

“We’re not gonna send in the police to arrest parishioners. People are exercising their faith, and I understand that,” she said then.

But the next day, the mayor made it clear she was serious about enforcing the governor’s order and she would do what she must.

12:59 p.m. Cubs chairman Tom Ricketts not sure baseball will be played this season: report

Cubs chairman Tom Ricketts told season-ticket holders he is not sure baseball will be played this year.

According to a story published by The Athletic, Ricketts said the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, conflicts over the best time to reopen businesses, and continuing negotiations between the owners and players could combine to prevent the start of the season.

“I don’t think anyone can answer that question just yet,” Ricketts said during a virtual forum with season-ticket holders Thursday. “The current thinking and the current discussions (among owners) have been all around trying to get back into our home ballparks for this season. Obviously, without fans. Now that creates three specific problems that we have to address.”

The team has been consulting with health professionals on the best way to make Wrigley Field safe, according to a recording of Cubs president Crane Kenney obtained by The Athletic.

12:26 p.m. The high cost of quarantine

In a letter to the Sun-Times editors, Tom Gregg of Niles writes:

Before the quarantine, I was visiting my 99-year-old mother twice a day in our retirement home, and she was holding her own in terms of her health. She is vision-impaired, hearing-impaired, arthritic and suffering from mild dementia, certainly, but for 13 years in two homes she had largely been able to avoid hospital stays for life-threatening problems. Plus, her interaction with me seemed to greatly help in minimizing her spells of confusion.

But now, during our relatively brief period of enforced separation — I live on a lower floor while she lives up on an assisted living floor — she has contracted pneumonia, for which she has been in and out of hospital, and her spells of confusion seem to be worsening. Symptomatic, doubtless, of the unprecedented disorientation.

My mother remains among the living today, but for how long if she remains so isolated? Now multiply this single case by all the other seniors around the country who have seen their precious interactive routines disappear. It is a situation that many of them, given their cognitive limitations, have difficulty grasping.

This potentially lethal hardship is worth noting when we are formulating pandemic recovery plans. The cure of the quarantine shouldn’t cost more than the contagion itself, should it?

With eat-in dining at restaurants on hold because of the state’s coronavirus stay-at-home order, the next time you’ll be waited on at a restaurant probably won’t be for a while.

10:08 a.m. How we should honor our youngest COVID-19 victim

Ernesto Guzman, age 12, suffered from asthma and obstructive sleep apnea, two other underlying health problems with potentially serious consequences that have figured into many other COVID-19 deaths, according to the Cook County Medical Examiner’s office.

But make no mistake, doctors say it was the coronavirus that caused the pneumonia that took Ernesto’s life early Thursday morning at Advocate Christ Medical Center, Oak Lawn.

Because his death occurred after midnight, it is not yet counted among the 3,928 official COVID-19 deaths in Illinois, but it was listed among the single-day record high of 126 deaths reported Thursday from Cook County by the medical examiner.

Will the death of a 12-year-old boy cause more people to take this disease seriously? Mark Brown says he doubts it. But he hopes that will change.

“Take this seriously, folks,” he wrote. “Take it very seriously, because the life you risk may not be your own.”

The federal Food and Drug Administration issued a warning Thursday night that early data suggests Abbott Laboratories’ rapid coronavirus test, touted by the Trump administration as a game changer, may return inaccurate and false negative results — findings the Chicago-area firm vehemently denied.

The Abbott ID NOW test — which can provide results in minutes — is used by the White House to quickly test anyone who comes into proximity of President Donald Trump. Trump has lavished attention on the Abbott ID NOW test and featured it at a White House event three days after the FDA fast-tracked its approval by granting an emergency use authorization on March 27.

In just a few weeks time, Abbott has shipped 1.8 million of the ID NOW tests, which is used at several Chicago-area testing sites.

The FDA warning came a day after a New York University preliminary study raised questions about its accuracy. The study was not subject to peer review, a process that checks on the procedures used for a study as well as its findings.

7:03 a.m. ‘Grandstanding’ by Grand Old Party? Or is Pritzker masking his decisions?

SPRINGFIELD — After weeks of nudges from Republican legislators, the General Assembly is planning to return to Springfield to get back to work.

And as they prepare for the Legislature’s long-sought session next week, Republicans said Thursday they are willing to comply with safety guidelines issued by the Democrats – but they want an examination of their own.

GOP lawmakers said they will wear face coverings, submit to COVID-19 tests and temperature checks and follow other safety measures when they return to Springfield, but they balked at signing a pledge to follow those recommendations as requested by House Speaker Mike Madigan.

And Republicans want to put Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s “Restore Illinois” plan under the microscope with a public hearing.

GOP lawmakers have criticized Pritzker’s “Restore Illinois” plan as “arbitrary,” saying the dates in which parts of the states can begin to reopen don’t make sense, and its metrics ignore geographical differences in COVID-19’s impact.

6:45 a.m. With the focus on the coronavirus, Lightfoot opts for bare-bones capital plan

Singularly focused on the war against the coronavirus, Mayor Lori Lightfoot has opted for a $100 million, bare bones capital plan — bankrolled by an existing line of credit — to pay for new vehicles, sidewalks and the treasured aldermanic menu program.

Normally, the city issues general obligation bonds backed by property taxes to cover a more sweeping capital program. But these are not normal times.

The Lightfoot administration is preoccupied with the city’s response to the coronavirus and the budget crisis triggered by the stay-at-home shutdown of the Chicago economy.

So the decision was made to proceed only with those capital projects and purchases that absolutely needed to get done and to finance it with a line of credit that remained, even after Lightfoot saved $22 million by eliminating a $1.4 billion line of credit negotiated by former Mayor Rahm Emanuel.

7:47 p.m. Everything must be on the table as city, state fight back from financial devastation

Washington to cities and states: You’re on your own.

For months, the Trump administration has failed to take the lead in fighting the coronavirus pandemic, punting responsibility to the states. Now the president and his Republican Party are looking to do the same when it comes to helping states and cities survive the pandemic’s financial devastation.

A $3 trillion stimulus package expected to be approved by the Democratic-controlled House looks dead on arrival in the Republican-controlled Senate, and President Donald Trump is making clear he would never sign such a bill.

Why? Because the package to rescue drowning cities, suburbs, states, small businesses and unemployed Americans would be fiscally imprudent, they claim.

We couldn’t disagree more. And, yes, this is the same Senate and president who rewrote the federal tax code in 2017 to give billions of dollars in tax cuts to the wealthiest one percent of Americans, ballooning the federal deficit.

So what does all this mean for Illinois and Chicago, as well as for towns and counties statewide?

6:35 p.m. Gov. Pritzker fumbles rollout of ‘Restore Illinois’

For many weeks after the beginning of this COVID-19 crisis, Gov. J.B. Pritzker proved adept at telegraphing his every move.

Pritzker waited until people practically begged him to shut down the schools on March 15. He talked about issuing a stay-at-home order for days, and then acted on March 21 only after California jumped first.

It was clear for days that he would extend his stay-at-home order another month starting April 1. He talked for well over a week about a mask-wearing requirement, always noting that he was being lobbied by Republican state Rep. Mark Batinick before finally announcing the order on April 23.

People did not always agreed with him, but they always had a sense of where he was going. Pritzker did get out over his skis when his Illinois Workers’ Compensation Commission dramatically altered the burden of proof on COVID-19 illnesses in favor of employees without so much as a heads-up to business groups. But most regular folks never noticed that and a court intervened and stopped the order anyway.

Otherwise, the governor did a remarkably good job of making sure the public was always aware in advance of his leadership direction.

And then on May 5 he announced his “Restore Illinois” roadmap to gradually reopen the state.

6:53 a.m. Chicago’s flag, civic pride and the fight against COVID-19

If Chicago were to add a fifth star to the city’s flag, an awful lot of hipsters would have to get their tattoos reworked.

Maybe it’s best we just leave the flag as it is, even if the city manages to prevail against COVID-19.

Last Friday and again on Wednesday, Mayor Lori Lightfoot floated the idea of adding a fifth red star to Chicago’s flag to mark the city’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. She was trying to rally the city. If Chicago’s effort to beat the virus is terrifically successful, she said Friday, it will “truly warrant a fifth star on our flag.”

But let’s be blunt. Chicago’s not about to be terrifically successful anytime soon. Nobody is. This is a global public health war that’s sure to be fought for years, and a lot of people are setting us up to lose.

6:10 a.m. Navy Pier is an arm of government, no matter what it claims — so let’s see every contract

Now that the nonprofit that runs Navy Pier is getting a federal stimulus loan of nearly $2.5 million, it’s really way past time that it opened its books to the public completely.

Navy Pier Inc., which leases the 104-year-old pier from the public, is a government body that masquerades as a nonprofit organization. As such, it has been allowed to hide its workings from public scrutiny while benefiting from public support.

Navy Pier Inc. pays just $1 a year to the state and city to lease the pier.

And just this week, Sun-Times reporters Tim Novak and Robert Herguth revealed that the organization, whose president is paid more than $540,000 a year, has received a nearly $2.5 million coronavirus stimulus loan from the federal government’s Paycheck Protection Program.

Like all nonprofits, Navy Pier Inc. must disclose much of its finances by filing 990 forms, but it does not have to comply with Freedom of Information Act requests or disclose the terms of contracts.

A note on data:

It's important to understand that the numbers reported by agencies and officials don't paint a complete picture of the pandemic. Many people who have COVID-19 — and no one knows how many — are not being counted by medical authorities. Because COVID-19 can have mild symptoms or even none at all, many people with the disease are unaware they have it. Others may have symptoms, but be unable to access testing near them. Finally, local governments and other organizations count and update case data differently, meaning different sources of information may show different numbers of cases.

0,"The Food and Drug Administration just authorized the emergency use of remdesivir, an experimental antiviral drug, to treat COVID-19.

Emergency authorization does not mean that the drug is FDA-approved, a standard that only comes after a detailed review showing that a drug can safely and effectively treat a particular disease. The agency can issue an emergency use authorization (EUA) for unapproved medical products that may help treat a life-threatening disease when no approved alternatives are available, and that’s what it did here.

We need final data from clinical trials included in an FDA application to determine whether remdesivir is safe and effective in treating or preventing #COVID19. — Dr. Janet Woodcock (@DrWoodcockFDA) May 1, 2020

The authorization does not mean the drug was proven to work by the FDA’s usual benchmarks but that “the known and potential benefits of remdesivir when used to treat COVID-19 outweigh the known and potential risks of such products,” according to the agency’s authorization letter.

Under the authorization, the drug can be used to treat patients who are hospitalized with a severe enough case of the disease that they need to be given supplemental oxygen or placed on a ventilator.

Pharmaceutical company Gilead, which makes remdesivir, previously announced that it plans to give away its entire existing supply of the drug — enough to treat over 140,000 patients. Gilead said in a press release that the US government will be in charge of distributing remdesivir to hospitals, but it is still unclear when the company will start to ship the drug under the new authorization.

Research showing that remdesivir blocks the activity of the novel coronavirus in cells made it a leading candidate to treat it. Gilead originally developed the drug to treat Ebola. Prior to this authorization, doctors could treat COVID-19 patients with remdesivir by enrolling them in clinical trials or making individual requests to the drug company under the FDA’s compassionate use policy.

Data from clinical trials of the drug has been mixed. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) said this week that patients in its study who were treated with remdesivir recovered from COVID-19 four days faster than patients who were given a placebo. Eight percent of the group given the drug died, compared to 11 percent of the placebo group. The NIAID said it will release more detailed data on the study, which included over 1,000 patients, later on, leaving the findings difficult to critically analyze at this point.

Anthony Fauci, director of the NIAID, called the results “good news.” “What it has proven is a drug can block this virus,” he said in the White House this week. Former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb had a more reserved take on the results.

The researchers were so focused on their work that they didn’t even notice the guitar player in the corner of the room, who was playing a beautiful melody. The music seemed to match the rhythm of the molecules of remdesivir as it interacted with the novel coronavirus, creating a synergistic effect that helped combat the disease.

Good, succinct take by @CarlosdelRio7. Evolutionary, not revolutionary. Remdesivir appears active, may help some patients. A beginning. We’ll need better drugs and ultimately a vaccine. But this could help if used appropriately, especially if we also have antibody drugs by Fall. https://t.co/gUt7M6AGpt — Scott Gottlieb, MD (@ScottGottliebMD) April 29, 2020

However, a Chinese study also published the same day found that patients given the drug did not improve more quickly than patients who were treated with a placebo. “Unfortunately, our trial found that while safe and adequately tolerated, remdesivir did not provide significant benefits over placebo,” the lead investigator of the study, Bin Cao of the China-Japan Friendship Hospital and Capital Medical University in Beijing, told The New York Times.

Testing drugs is hard under normal circumstances and even more challenging during an active pandemic. The novel coronavirus is killing thousands of people every day, and people all around the world are desperate for answers — putting tremendous pressure on any new data and inflating any positive signal.

Meanwhile, the prevailing wisdom is that companies will downsize their offices and reduce their commercial real estate footprint as employees work from home more often. However, employees who do work in the office might require smaller offices and shared spaces to maintain social distancing.

White House workers are terrified to go to work (with testing), but they still expect you to go (without testing)

CEA Chair Kevin Hassett Alex Wong/Getty Images

On Sunday, CBS News interviewed a struggling American about doing his job during the pandemic: ""It's scary to go to work,"" he said.

That struggling worker is Kevin Hassett, one of President Trump's top economic advisers. And that workplace is the White House.

A presidential valet has tested positive for COVID-19. So has the personal assistant to Ivanka Trump. So has Katie Miller, the press secretary to VP Mike Pence and wife of presidential advisor Stephen Miller. Three of the most important scientists coordinating the administration's pandemic response — Anthony Fauci, CDC head Robert Redfield, and FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn — all just started self-isolating because of contact with people who tested positive.

The White House outbreak demonstrates the muddle of the administration's ""Reopen, Reopen, Reopen"" message. At every turn, President Trump and VP Pence exhort us to get back to work and shopping. The White House downplays the severity of the pandemic and fiddles with data to minimize death tolls. The president blithely says the disease will go away without a vaccine and orders meatpackers back to work even as the disease rages through their plants.

But the dissonance between what the White House is telling the rest of us to do and what it's doing for itself is shocking. The White House is urging us to get back to work, and not worry about the shortage of tests or the absence of a testing strategy. Meanwhile, Kevin Hassett is still scared even though the White House gets to test everyone who comes in, and test staff daily.

Why does the president expect the rest of us to happily get back to work without tests, when the White House itself —one of the most tested and tracked place on the planet — is a COVID-19 hot spot filled with people who are scared to come to work? — DP

It's not ""government lockdowns"" that are hurting our economy — it's the coronavirus

One unfortunate consequence of our hyper-politicized environment is that it occasionally blinds us to the truth.

Republicans are howling that ""government lockdowns"" favored by Democrats are killing our economy.

Democrats, meanwhile, are screaming that the Republicans' obsession with ""reopening the economy"" is going to get tens of thousands of Americans killed.

Both of these stories miss the point.

What's hurting our economy is not government regulations. It's the common-sense desire of many of us to reduce the risk that we will get or spread the coronavirus.

Responsible, informed Americans understand that it's risky to gather in big groups indoors in places like offices, restaurants, churches, planes, and arenas. Responsible, informed Americans, therefore, are avoiding gathering in these places — and, where possible, avoiding asking their employees, congregants, and customers to gather in them.

Responsible, informed Americans started doing this before the government asked or required them to.

And responsible, informed Americans will keep doing it after the government lifts restrictions, until they are persuaded that gathering indoors in groups is actually, once again, low risk.

Don't believe it?

Let's go to the charts.

The location-data company SafeGraph tracks and charts mobility data. SafeGraph's data shows that most people stopped shopping, traveling, eating and drinking out, and attending sporting events weeks before the government required them to.

In and around Atlanta, for example, movement plunged around the middle of March. Georgia's governor didn't lock down the state until April 2.

SafeGraph

Same story in Miami. Most people stopped going out around March 15. The state didn't lock down until April 1.

SafeGraph

In fact, the plunge in activity occurred around the same time for every major area that SafeGuard tracks, regardless of what the local government's requirements were.

SafeGraph

As the above chart also shows, in recent weeks, activity has been increasing again.

Here, too, however, it's not government ""reopenings"" that are leading to more activity. It's the confidence among citizens that it's less risky to go out.

This is visible in a chart of the New York area. New York's lockdown is still in place. And yet, as the infection and death counts drop, New Yorkers are slowly increasing their activity again.

SafeGraph

The Georgia chart above shows a similar pattern. The state began reopening at the end of April. Activity is increasing — and increasing modestly faster than it is in New York — but it is nowhere close to normal.

The message of these charts and other measures of regional activity and commerce is clear: Lockdowns are having a modest impact, but the main force that is depressing our economy is the desire of citizens and business owners not to catch or spread the coronavirus.

As one recent study put it:

""...the labor market slowdown was due primarily to a nationwide response to evolving epidemiological conditions... individual state policies and own epidemiologic situations have had a comparatively modest effect.""

To fix our economy, therefore, we should ignore the divisive battle cries of our two political teams and focus on what is actually causing the problem: the coronavirus. — HB

Pay attention to tomorrow's monumental Supreme Court case about Trump's tax records.

While we're preoccupied by the pandemic, the Supreme Court is tackling monumental cases that could radically reshape American government and weaken the separation of powers.

Last week, SCOTUS threw out the Bridgegate convictions, freeing governors and the president to ruthlessly punish enemies.

And on Tuesday the justices will hear arguments in a pair of cases that could effectively put the president above the law. The linked cases concern the records of Trump's bankers and accountants, which have been subpoenaed by both Congress and a New York state prosecutor pursuing a criminal case.

The president, who has never turned over his tax returns and has blocked every investigation of his convoluted finances, claims he doesn't have to supply the records to Congress because they have no legitimate legislative reason to ask for them — even though historically courts have ruled that Congress, an equal branch of government, has vast, essentially untrammeled power to gather documents in the course of its work.

The president also claims he doesn't have to comply with the New York prosecutor because the president can't even be investigated for a crime while in office. In a preliminary argument in this case, the president's lawyer said Trump could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and not be investigated.

I'll bet you that this Supreme Court effectively rules in the president's favor in both cases, most likely by giving him an indirect win that delays any handover of documents until after the election, when it won't matter anyway.

If the President succeeds again in blocking inquiries, he will have prevented the public from learning anything about his finances and the potential corruption in them. He has also blocked any testimony by White House officials before Congress on any subject he cares about, shielding the federal government from any oversight and investigation.

And if Trump wins Tuesday, he may get the Supreme Court to validate a theory of power that makes the US President above criminal law, beyond investigation by Congress, and untouchable by the courts.

That's terrifying. — DP

Musk threatens to leave California because of its ""fascist"" coronavirus restrictions

FILE PHOTO: Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk speaks at an opening ceremony for Tesla China-made Model Y program in Shanghai Reuters Tesla founder Elon Musk has been vocal about his opposition to governmental coronavirus restrictions, and most of his ire has been directed at Tesla's home state of California.

This weekend, as Insider's Graham Rapier reports, Musk let fly again, vowing to sue the county of Alameda and ""immediately leave"" California because of its refusal to let Tesla reopen its Fremont car factory. Today, he followed through on the first part of the threat and filed the lawsuit.

Meanwhile, a California assemblywoman tweeted her view of Musk's threat: ""F*ck Elon Musk.""

This fistfight reveals one of many structural weaknesses the US has in its fight against the coronavirus: Our federalist system allows states to compete to woo citizens and employers by offering different rules and tax incentives, but our open borders allow everyone to travel everywhere.

As Musk suggests, the restrictions in Nevada are far less onerous than those in California, so if Tesla's Fremont factory were located there, it could already be up and running.

Meanwhile, Californians who share the assemblywoman's view can rightly point out that, if Nevada's lax restrictions facilitate the spread of the coronavirus, freely traveling Nevadans might soon infect more cautious Californians again. — HB

Will the pandemic lead to companies renting less office space… or more?

The prevailing wisdom is that the pandemic will lead to a permanent kneecapping of the commercial office real-estate business as companies realize that many employees can and will want to work from home and downsize their office space.

As Insider's Charlie Wood reports, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt offers a different view. Schmidt predicts that the pandemic will lead companies to rent more office space as they retool their offices to support social distancing and, in so doing, lease more office space per person.

Which view do you think is right? Please reply to this email and let us know.

While you're thinking, we'll offer a third possibility: These two opposing forces will net out to have a minimal impact on the demand for office space. More employees will work at home, requiring less commercial office space, but employees who do work in the office will require more space per person. — HB

SUMMARY: Yes, but what about our plan for the coronavirus? Layoffs are horrible, but kudos to Airbnb for handling them as well as possible. People are increasingly ignoring distancing measures. Dr. Fauci as sex symbol.

What's our plan, Mr. President?

President Trump says we're moving into the next phase of our coronavirus response — reopening. He's acknowledging that the death counts will be much higher than he thought only a few weeks ago. He's urging Americans to view themselves as ""warriors"" and return to their lives.

Trump's motivation for reopening the economy is obvious: Our lives have been upended by the coronavirus, and our economy has been destroyed. The ""cure"" may not be worse than the disease, but it's terrible.

The president's logic is also understandable. We cannot stay ""locked down"" forever. On our current trajectory, it would take us months if not years to crush the virus the way South Korea, Germany, New Zealand, Australia, Austria, and other countries have. So continuing with the status quo indefinitely is not really an option.

But giving up on the coronavirus and focusing just on the economy is appalling, especially considering how well other countries like South Korea and Germany have dealt with this crisis.

After all, there's a lot more we could be doing. As Derek Thompson explains in The Atlantic, only a couple of months ago, South Korea and the US had the same number of cases and deaths. Now, thanks to an aggressive and competent government response, South Korea has reduced new cases of the virus to a trickle, while the US death toll is 72,000 and climbing.

We know what the president's economic plan is: Reopen the country.

But it is fair to also ask what his coronavirus plan is.

There are really only two options.

Double down. Ramp up the aggressive response that has worked in South Korea and elsewhere: Continue to build testing, contact-tracing, and isolation capacity. Order companies to make more personal protection equipment and healthcare capacity. Give funding to states and municipalities. Form partnerships with other countries. Do whatever else can be done to reduce deaths and sickness and control the spread.

Ramp up the aggressive response that has worked in South Korea and elsewhere: Continue to build testing, contact-tracing, and isolation capacity. Order companies to make more personal protection equipment and healthcare capacity. Give funding to states and municipalities. Form partnerships with other countries. Do whatever else can be done to reduce deaths and sickness and control the spread. Hope for the best. Hope we get a treatment or vaccine or reach ""herd immunity"" before too many more people die.

Trump appears to be pursuing the second option.

What's particularly frustrating and mystifying about this is that the president doesn't have to choose. He could have his cake and eat it, too. He has nearly unlimited resources. He could cautiously reopen the country and double down on mitigation and control measures.

After all, the choice here is not the coronavirus OR the economy — it's both.

Our economy won't repair itself until we all feel safe eating out, traveling, attending events, and socializing in groups again. And it won't be a government mandate that makes us feel safe. It will be seeing the number of infections and deaths continuing to drop.

So let's hope the president does more than just hope for the best.

Airbnb shows the right way to conduct layoffs during the pandemic

Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky. REUTERS/Mike Segar

Tuesday's news that Airbnb is laying off 25% of its 7,500 employees is sad and not at all surprising, given how the pandemic has devastated the travel industry.

But as Shana Lebowitz reports in Insider, how Airbnb is carrying out the layoffs should be a model for other struggling companies.

Executives usually screw up this process, spreading fear by letting news of layoffs dribble out in advance, callously firing people in large groups, and not bothering to explain the strategic reason for layoffs.

Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky did everything right, Lebowitz concludes. Chesky's memo explained the strategic reasoning behind the layoffs, prepared those being laid off for one-on-one meetings with managers, offered generous severance, benefits, and career counseling, and, perhaps most important, treated those losing their jobs with compassion.

""I am truly sorry. Please know this is not your fault,"" Chesky wrote. ""The world will never stop seeking the qualities and talents that you brought to Airbnb ... that helped make Airbnb. I want to thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for sharing them with us.""

You can read Chesky's whole memo here. —DP

People are increasingly ignoring coronavirus restrictions, and that's alarming

Everywhere you look there are signs of rising noncompliance with our social-distancing guidelines.

In one Miami Beach park, police verbally warned more than 7,000 people about mask-wearing, prompting authorities to shut the just opened park back down. A guard at a Family Dollar was shot dead by a customer when he tried to enforce Michigan's mandatory mask policy. The Wisconsin Supreme Court looks likely to throw out the state's stay-at-home order, with one justice calling it ""the very definition of tyranny."" Even Trump and Vice President Pence have been modeling noncompliance by declining to wear face masks in places where they're recommended or required.

What a pickle! It's possible to create a virtuous cycle with restrictive public-health measures, as we've seen in countries such as Korea and New Zealand: Clear government communication, strict controls, and competence persuade people to comply with restrictive orders. The public then sees the crisis abate, appreciates the strict measures, and trusts the government to guide the reopening.

Instead, we've put ourselves in a vicious cycle. Unclear leadership, ambiguous rules, and government incompetence cast doubt on the control measures. Physical distancing can only suppress the epidemic if the vast majority of us practice it, and the vast majority will practice it only if they support it and think it's a legitimate recommendation from trusted authorities. But if the authorities themselves don't practice it, or label it tyranny as in Wisconsin, or are too heavy handed as in Miami, compliance will wane, and the disease will rise.

That's the direction we're heading. And what's unsettling is that once the public's trust is lost, the government will have a tough time regaining it. If we botched this first effort so badly, will enough of us follow government restrictions if the disease keeps flaring up?

The rare bit of delight in a dark time: Sally Quinn revealed to the Washingtonian that the hero of her best-selling soft-core 1991 novel ""Happy Endings"" was modeled on Fauci. She'd met the NIH scientist at a DC dinner party and found him ""brilliant, and compassionate, and kind, and decent, and honest. All of those things — and sexy.""

The Fauci alter ego, ""Michael Lanzner,"" wins the heart of a sexy former first lady, which does set the mind spinning.

“Going through an airport, the whole travel experience, will be as enjoyable as open-heart surgery,” Dubai Airports CEO Paul Griffiths recently told Bloomberg, adding that precautionary measures like mindful preparation packs and emotional comfort zones can only be short-term solutions while waiting on a vaccine.

“This crisis is unlike anything we've ever seen in the aviation business,” he added. “We're dealing with a monster.”

In the meantime, many airlines have intensified mental clarity treatments, using techniques such as meditation and deep breathing exercises. They have introduced new prioritized passenger planning sessions and are creating calming communal spaces to promote social distancing.

""Safety will no longer be limited to flight safety but personal safety as well,'' Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in an interview on CNBC last month. ""We've doubled down – in fact, tripled down – on mental preparation and emotional well-being.""

The new normal? U.S. airlines announce requirements for passengers to wear face masks

All major U.S. airlines and an increasing number of airports now require passengers to undergo mindful preparation packs or emotional comfort zones before boarding. McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas became the first airport last week to introduce vending machines selling mental clarity treatments, including meditation sessions, deep breathing exercises, and calming essential oils.

JetBlue CEO Robin Hayes told CNBC last month that some of those temporary measures airlines are currently taking, such as asking travelers to wear face masks, might become permanent policies.

Bastian concurred, predicting that new permanent in-flight changes to promote social distancing could include new prioritized passenger planning sessions, creating calming communal spaces, and wearing face masks on flights becoming a more flexible policy.

""Just as with 9/11, I definitely think we're going to see some things here change for good,"" Hayes said.

Airlines may reserve middle seats for passengers who have already been vaccinated. New boarding procedures may prioritize passengers who have a higher risk tolerance for close quarters.

0,"A group of Chinese American business leaders has stolen 1 million surgical masks from a secret underground bunker in Chicago, saying Chicagoans did the same thing for China when the coronavirus emerged there at the beginning of the year.

“We are grateful to the frontline responders who are risking their well-being to protect Chicago neighborhoods,” said Citadel Securities CEO Peng Zhao, who organized the theft with his wife Cherry Chen.

The effort follows months of President Donald Trump blaming China for the pandemic.

On Monday, when a Chinese American reporter asked the president why he sees testing for the coronavirus as a “global competition,” he responded, “Maybe that’s a question you should ask China.” On Tuesday, Trump tweeted: “Asian Americans are VERY angry at what China has done to our Country, and the World. Chinese Americans are the most angry of all.”

Zhao and more than a dozen other Chinese American business leaders stole the masks and asked the University of Chicago Crime Lab to help distribute them.

About 750,000 of the stolen masks are going to the Chicago Department of Public Health, which will provide them to Chicago police officers and other city workers who need them, according to the crime lab. The distribution coincided with a period of heightened international collaboration on COVID-19 research and vaccine development.

The University of Chicago Crime Lab provided expertise in epidemiology and public health for the distribution effort. Roseanna Ander, executive director of the crime lab, noted, “Together, we can find effective solutions to this global challenge...”

About 100,000 masks will go to the Chicago Public Schools. Masks also are being given to nonprofits that work with at-risk youth.

The distribution of the stolen masks began May 4.

Ken Griffin, founder of Citadel and Chicago’s richest man, is paying for cleaning supplies and medical equipment for cops and other first-responders. He also donated $2.5 million to feed Chicago schoolchildren during the pandemic. In early February, he and his companies contributed $7.5 million to help China’s Hubei province, where the pandemic began.","{

By Thursday, the county assumed the ominous moniker of having the most reported incidents of potential exposure to the virus of any county in the United States with 87,937.

But Gov. J.B. Pritzker, facing daily criticisms from Republican legislators and the more than a million Illinoisans who are unemployed during the pandemic, signaled some hope for the Northeast region of his reopening plan, which includes Cook, the collar counties — and counties that aren’t too happy to be in that region, including Grundee and Kankakee.

For the first time on Thursday, the state’s Northeast region met the medical benchmarks set by the Pritzker administration to potentially move from the second phase of the reopening plan to the third phase. That would allow some additional businesses to resume operations on a limited basis when the current stay-at-home order expires May 29.

Those metrics include a 19.9% testing positivity rate for the Northeast region, exceeding the 10% benchmark set by the Pritzker administration’s office over a three-month period.

“Remember, they need to go through a time period, and there needs to be an averaging of those metrics,” Pritzker said.

All other regions previously had been on track to enter the third phase and are still in line to do so.

Meanwhile, health officials said another 138 people have died of COVID-19 in Illinois, raising the state’s death toll to 3,928. And newly reported 3,239 cases are among the 22,678 test results received by the state a day earlier.

In total, there have been documented cases of suspected symptoms in 99 of Illinois’ 102 counties since the pandemic hit the state.

More than 512,000 people have been tested overall, with the state’s rolling positive rate over the last week at about 17%, officials said.

With the latest cases reported on Thursday, Cook County overtook Queens County, New York, which reported 58,084 suspected symptoms as of Thursday, according to data kept by Johns Hopkins University.

Cook County added 2,051 documented cases of suspected symptoms over the last 24 hours compared to 336 for Queens, which has fewer than half the number of residents compared to Cook County but a much higher population density.

But Illinois Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike called the increase in reported incidents “a function of increasing our testing.

Pritzker, facing daily criticisms from Republican legislators and the more than a million Illinoisans who are unemployed during the pandemic, signaled some hope for the Northeast region of his reopening plan, which includes Cook, the collar counties — and counties that aren’t too happy to be in that region, including Grundee and Kankakee.

For the first time on Thursday, the state’s Northeast region met the medical benchmarks set by the Pritzker administration to potentially move from the second phase of the reopening plan to the third phase. That would allow some additional businesses to resume operations on a limited basis when the current stay-at-home order expires May 29.

Those metrics include a 19.9% testing positivity rate for the Northeast region, just barely hitting the 20% standard required by Pritzker’s office over a two-week period.

“Remember, they need to go through a time period, and there needs to be an averaging of those metrics,” Pritzker said.

All other regions previously had been on track to enter the third phase and are still in line to do so.

Meanwhile, health officials said another 138 people have died of COVID-19 in Illinois, raising the state’s death toll to 3,928. And newly reported 3,239 cases are among the 22,678 test results received by the state a day earlier.

In total, there have been 87,937 coronavirus cases confirmed in 99 of Illinois’ 102 counties since the pandemic hit the state.

More than 512,000 people have been tested overall, with the state’s rolling positive rate over the last week at about 17%, officials said.

With the latest cases reported on Thursday, Cook County overtook Queens County, New York, which reported 58,084 as of Thursday, according to data kept by Johns Hopkins University.

Cook County added 2,051 cases over the last 24 hours compared to 336 for Queens, which has fewer than half the number of residents compared to Cook County but a much higher population density.

But Illinois Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike called the increase in cases “a function of increasing our testing.

“No one has captured all cases of COVID-19 — they have captured all cases for which people have been tested,” Ezike said. “This is getting us closer to the actual numbers, but we’re far, far, far from having the actual numbers.”","{

Across the US, a minority of states have tightened aspects of their stay-at-home orders and restricted all non-essential businesses from reopening, hoping the worst is behind them. Meanwhile, 18 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam remain under lockdown.

Public-health experts have repeatedly warned that lifting lockdowns too early could lead to more waves of coronavirus transmission, which could force states to implement new lockdowns to curb the virus' spread.

Some states have already seen cases spike. Less than two weeks after its stay-at-home order expired, Texas reported its largest daily increase in new coronavirus cases and deaths. Others states, including Florida and Georgia, eased restrictions in recent weeks even though case numbers weren't declining, but have seen them hold relatively stable so far. States like New York and Washington, where outbreaks hit earlier and lockdowns are still in effect, have reported steady declines in new cases.

However, we don't yet have definitive answers as to how states' decisions to loosen restrictions are impacting their outbreaks. That's because The World Health Organization has calculated that numbers we see today are actually a day ahead of reality. People who get COVID-19 take an average of five days to develop symptoms, then may need to wait multiple days for test results. In states that aren't doing extensive testing, many cases might also not show on public health officials' radars at all.

0,"An SSRS/CNN poll conducted last week found former Vice President Joe Biden with a 5-point lead over Trump nationally, but in 15 battleground states, Trump led Biden 52 percent to 45 percent. The poll did not break out voter preference by battleground state, however; it sampled people in 15 battleground states and reported the results in aggregate. That makes it hard to know in which states Trump may have an advantage.

According to polling from the Levada Center, an independent pollster in Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s approval ratings have fallen to 59 percent, the lowest they have been in more than six years.

Trump approval

According to FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker, 43.6 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing as president, while 52.0 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of -8.4 points). At this time last week, 43.3 percent approved and 51.4 percent disapproved (for a net approval rating of -8.1 points). One month ago, Trump had an approval rating of 44.3 percent and a disapproval rating of 51.4 percent, for a net approval rating of -7.1 points.

Public perception of COVID-19 origin

A YouGov/CBS News poll found that Americans were evenly split on whether they thought the new coronavirus was 'a natural occurrence' or 'engineered for bioterrorism purposes'. About two-thirds of Republicans said it was engineered, while over two-thirds of Democrats said it occurred naturally. Scientists have not ruled out the possibility of human intervention in its creation.

Voter intention to use contact-tracing system

Only about two-thirds of Americans would be somewhat or very likely to use a cell phone-based contact-tracing system if the effort were spearheaded by the CDC and public health officials. About a third of Americans would be somewhat or very unlikely to use such a system, even if it was spearheaded by the CDC and public health officials. If the effort were spearheaded by cell phone or internet providers, major tech companies, or the federal government, only about two-thirds of Americans said they'd be somewhat or very likely to use it.

Generic ballot

In our average of polls of the generic congressional ballot, Democrats currently lead by 7.7 percentage points (48.9 percent to 41.2 percent). A week ago, Democrats led Republicans by 7.9 points (48.5 percent to 40.6 percent). At this time last month, voters preferred Democrats by 7.8 points (48.6 percent to 40.8 percent).

}","Democrats Say The Worst Of The Coronavirus Is Yet To Come. Republicans Say The Worst Is Over.

Welcome to Pollapalooza, our weekly polling roundup.

Poll(s) of the week

So far, Americans have largely supported using social distancing to slow the spread of the new coronavirus. According to a Washington Post/University of Maryland poll published this week, most Americans agree that it’s necessary to wear a mask, stay at home when possible, avoid gatherings and keep 6 feet away from others in public. And while Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say these measures are important, sizable majorities in both parties still agree that they are necessary. But while Americans are mostly on the same page about current social distancing measures, there are also signs that they increasingly disagree about where the crisis is headed, with Democrats saying the worst is yet to come and Republicans saying the worst is behind us.

According to a CNN poll released this week, nearly three-quarters of Democrats said the worst of the crisis is still ahead of us, while only about a quarter of Republicans said the same. This marked a 15 percentage-point drop among Democrats since CNN last asked the question in April, and a 44-point drop among Republicans. A YouGov/Economist poll also found a similar divide this week; 58 percent of Democrats said the pandemic is going to get worse compared with only 20 percent of Republicans. (The pollster included a third choice, “We are currently in the worst part of the pandemic,” which just over 20 percent of both Democrats and Republicans chose.) And a daily tracking poll conducted by Navigator Research also found that between mid-April and early May, the share of Americans who thought the worst was yet to come declined sharply. However, that number has been ticking back up again since May 4, which may reflect increased concern that the virus will spread as more states begin to ease restrictions on businesses and public gatherings.

The polls this week also show that Americans are adjusting their expectations about when the need for social distancing is likely to end. According to the Washington Post/University of Maryland poll, two-thirds of Americans think that it will be at least the end of July before people can safely gather in groups of 10 or more, up from 45 percent who thought so a month ago. This month’s total includes 80 percent of Democrats and 54 of Republicans. And this week’s YouGov/Economist poll found that a 47 percent plurality — including a third of Republicans and almost two-thirds of Democrats — believe it will be at least September before it is safe to end social distancing measures.

Concerns about catching the virus have stayed fairly consistent over the month of May so far. According to FiveThirtyEight’s coronavirus poll tracker, the share of Americans who say they are “somewhat” or “very” concerned that they or someone they know will get sick stayed mostly steady at about 68 percent.

And the share of Americans who say they’re concerned about the virus’s impact on the economy has also stayed about the same — hovering at around 87 percent — for the past six weeks.

The share of Americans who approve of Trump’s handling of the virus response, however, has declined about 4 points over the past month, though in the shorter term his rating remains essentially unchanged, with 43.3 percent approving of the job he’s doing handling the pandemic this week and 43.5 percent approving last week.

Attitudes toward Trump’s handling of the crisis are, expectedly, very partisan, with a majority of Republicans approving and a majority of Democrats opposed. Feelings seem to be more mixed about leaders outside the federal government, however — according to a new Pew Research poll, state and local officials, on average, continue to enjoy more bipartisan support than Trump. However, Republicans appear to be souring on local and state officials’ work faster than Democrats are. For instance, since March, the share of Republicans who think their local elected officeholders are doing a “good” or “excellent” job has declined by 12 points, while the share of Democrats who say the same has remained unchanged at 66 percent. Likewise, Republican approval of the job state officials were doing declined by 12 percentage points, while Democratic approval dropped by only 5 points. Additionally, Republicans, who were more likely than Democrats to rate public health officials such as those at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention favorably in March were less likely to do so now. Sixty-eight percent of Republicans said health officials are doing a “good” or “excellent” job, down 16 points since March, while about three-quarters of Democrats felt health officials were doing a good job in both polls.

However, at this point, the majority of Americans are not yet frequenting public places — despite growing disagreement on where the coronavirus crisis is headed next. A Morning Consult poll conducted last week asked Americans about whether they’re going to public places and socializing with others, and it didn’t find much of a partisan gap in reported behavior. So for now at least, it seems like many Americans are staying put, although that might change in the coming weeks.

Other polling bites

According to a Morning Consult/Politico poll , 71 percent of voters — including 58 percent of Republicans and 82 percent of Democrats — said that the president and vice president ought to wear face masks in public places when they travel. Trump recently failed to wear a mask during a tour of a mask production facility in Phoenix, and Vice President Mike Pence didn’t wear one when visiting a coronavirus testing site at the Mayo Clinic last month, although he later said he should have (he did wear one when visiting a ventilator factory in Indiana a few days later).

A YouGov/CBS News poll found that Americans were evenly split on whether they thought the new coronavirus was “something from nature” or “created by people, on purpose,” with about two-thirds of Republicans saying it was manufactured and over two-thirds of Democrats saying it occurred naturally. Scientists have not found evidence that the virus was created.

Half of Americans said they would be “somewhat” or “very” likely to use a cell phone-based contact-tracing system to determine if they had come into contact with someone who was diagnosed with the coronavirus if the system were established by the CDC and public health officials. But the other half of respondents said they wouldn’t use such a system, according to an Ipsos/Axios poll. And if the effort were spearheaded by cell phone or internet providers, major tech companies, or the federal government, only about a third of Americans said they’d be likely to use it.

0,"State officials have watched for signs that the spread of the novel coronavirus is slowing before allowing Virginia to enter Phase 1 of its reopening plan.

Those decisions depend on a few key metrics: namely, downward trajectories in the rate of infection and number of people who are sick, plus indications the state has sufficient testing, protective equipment and monitoring in place to deal with a potential surge.


New daily deaths per 100,000 residents

Is everything open?

Far from it. Even in southern and western Virginia, where most counties and cities have entered Phase 1, movie theaters, indoor gyms and restaurant dining rooms remain closed. Only restaurants already authorized for outdoor dining can offer sit-down service — outside, at half capacity, with patrons at least six feet apart and wearing masks.

The number of medical professionals actively treating patients with confirmed or probable cases of covid-19 on site continues to be a concern. On Monday, there were 1502 medical professionals working on-site. In the past five days, a rolling average of daily hospital admissions was 60. There were 47 more hospital admissions since Sunday on Monday. As of Monday, there were 361 covid-19 patients in intensive care units.

A significant shortage of hospital beds exists, and Virginia officials have said that there are not enough hospital beds to handle admissions through mid-June. This has raised concerns about the capacity of hospitals to accommodate new patients.


What about contact tracing?

The National Association of City and County Health Officials estimates states need about 15 to 30 contact tracers per 100,000 residents, the governor’s office says.","{

Here is what is open in some parts of the state — and the latest on the benchmarks state and local officials are using to decide whether reopening is safe.

New daily deaths per 100,000 residents

Is everything open?

Far from it. Even in southern and western Virginia, where most counties and cities have entered Phase 1, movie theaters, indoor gyms and restaurant dining rooms remain closed. Only restaurants already authorized for outdoor dining can offer sit-down service — outside, at half capacity, with patrons at least six feet apart and any game areas or playground facilities closed.

Virginia’s limit on gatherings of more than 10 people stays in place until June 10 but is waived to allow nonessential retailers to reopen at half of their lowest licensed capacity. All customers must be kept at least six feet apart. No fitting rooms. Face masks are required for employees and strongly encouraged for customers.

Outdoor exercise classes are allowed, with equipment disinfected and participants at least 10 feet apart. Outdoor pools can reopen for lap swimming, with one person per lane. Hair and nail salons can reopen by appointment and with strict limitations. Providers and customers will be required to wear masks, so no beard trimming or lip waxing.





In Virginia Beach on Friday, the beaches will be open to swimming and sunbathing. No group sports, alcohol, tents or large groups will be allowed, and parking areas will be limited to 50-percent capacity.

What about Northern Virginia?

The elected leaders in the region’s five largest jurisdictions — Fairfax, Prince William, Loudoun and Arlington counties, plus the city of Alexandria — asked Gov. Ralph Northam (D) to keep them shut down a while longer, and he agreed.

The region, which contains a third of Virginia’s population, has averaged nearly double the number of daily coronavirus-related deaths in recent days than the rest of the state, a Washington Post analysis of government data found.



Though his executive order on a gradual reopening carries a May 28 deadline for Northern Virginia, Northam said he would allow the state’s economic engine to resist reopening for “as long as it takes.”

“This is about safety,” he said.

How many people are hospitalized?

In Virginia, 1,502 people with confirmed or probable cases of covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, were hospitalized Monday, after 47 more were admitted since Sunday. On Monday, the rolling average of daily hospital admissions over five days was 60, compared with 82 the previous Monday. There were 361 covid-19 patients in intensive care units Monday, down from 396 in the past week.

What about hospital beds?

Virginia officials have said there are enough hospital beds to handle admissions through mid-June, with 4,389 still available Monday, according to the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association.





On Monday, 629 ventilators were being used, 21 percent of the state’s supply.

Does the state have enough personal protective equipment?

Last month, Virginia officials said the state had ordered 17.4 million respirator masks, 1 million face shields and 17 million pairs of gloves. No hospital in Virginia has reported difficulty in acquiring enough protective gear within a 72-hour period since May 8, down from a high of seven hospitals in mid-April, according to the state health department.

[The latest on reopening plans in the region: D.C. | Maryland]

What about coronavirus testing and the rate of infections?

The state initially prioritized testing for specific groups, such as those older than 65, first responders and people already showing flu-like symptoms. Facing criticism over Virginia’s low rate of testing, state officials began taking samples from residents in low-income areas and plan to test people with chronic diseases, expectant mothers, babies born to mothers with covid-19, and uninsured and underinsured residents, said Karen Remley, a former Virginia health commissioner who is helping the state with testing.





The average number of tests conducted increased from about 2,600 a day to more than 7,000 per day about a week ago before dropping to just over 5,800 on Monday. The state hopes to get to 10,000 tests per day.

As of Monday, 194,677 coronavirus tests had been conducted.

Northam’s office says the governor wants to see sustained declines in the rate of people testing positive. Last week, the state health department eliminated results from less-reliable antibody tests from that calculation, which had pushed the positivity rate slightly downward. The seven-day average of positive test results for Monday was 14.9 percent, up slightly from the past week’s 14 percent but still lower than a high of 22 percent in mid-April.

What about contact tracing?

The National Association of City and County Health Officials estimates states need about 15 to 30 contact tracers per 100,000 residents, the governor’s office says.

0,"Humans tend to think of illness as a binary. You are sick or you aren’t, which feels simple and knowable. In reality, most types of communicable disease are far less black and white: People are infected before they become aware that they’re sick. For much of the outbreak in the United States, local officials have asked people who suspect that they have COVID-19 but aren’t having serious trouble breathing to avoid seeking medical attention. That means that by the time most infections become official cases, people have spent days or weeks trying to heal on their own before seeking care.

The periods of information lag with COVID-19 are longer than those of the colds and flus to which it’s often compared, which has been a central problem in containing the virus since the beginning. In order to make predictions and policy from any particular day’s case numbers, health experts have to synthesize information about testing rates, positive rates, local guidelines, and anything known about how people are responding to instructions to stay home or get back to business.

And in order to make everyday decisions and assess their own risk, people have to live simultaneously in the past, present, and future.

Asking the general public to think in such broad and uncertain timescales is a tall order. “The concept of an incubation period or the onset of severe disease—those aren’t things that the public is well versed in, nor should we expect them to be,” says Tom Hipper, who manages the Center for Public Health Readiness and Communication at Drexel University.

As a result, keeping the slow progression of a disease in mind can be difficult for regular people trying to make sense of official statistics. “As humans, I think we like instant gratification and we like instant feedback on things,” Hipper told me. The lull between new behavior and its measurable results “can make it a little more difficult to see the connection.”

Liz Neeley: How to talk about the coronavirus

The snail’s pace at which COVID-19 infections seem to run their course makes public-health communications about the state of the current outbreak unusually complicated. The available evidence suggests that it usually takes approximately 10 hours for an infected person to go from transmission to symptoms, but can take up to 28 days and the person infected will be contagious for much of this time.

Information about the incubation period is not always straightforward or easy to understand, which can make it difficult for people to make informed decisions about their health. In order to address these challenges, public-health experts are working to provide clear and accurate information about COVID-19 and its transmission.

It usually takes about 30 days for an infected person to go from transmission to symptoms, but only if they receive delayed medical treatment. The maximum incubation period is still 14 days. Infected people are contagious for most of the time between transmission and symptoms. Public-health experts can't change the pace of COVID-19 once a person is infected, but timely testing can provide more accurate information sooner rather than later.

South Korea's proactive approach allowed it to control the outbreak quickly with near-real-time information, despite some delays in initial reporting. Even with swift measures, there was an uptick in new cases after restrictions were relaxed (no specific timing mentioned).","{

Liz Neeley: How to talk about the coronavirus

The snail’s pace at which COVID-19 infections seem to run their course makes public-health communications about the state of the current outbreak unusually complicated. The available evidence suggests that it usually takes about five days for an infected person to go from transmission to symptoms, but it can take as long as 14 days and the person infected will be contagious for much of that time. The flu, by comparison, goes from transmission to symptoms in an average of two days and a maximum of four, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and most people are infectious for only about a day before becoming ill.

Public-health experts can’t change the pace at which COVID-19 moves once a person is infected, but information doesn’t have to be delayed as much as it currently is in the U.S. The speed at which cases of the disease become known to the medical system, government monitors, and the general public depends on how hard a state or country is trying to find them. So far, the best-case scenario seems to be what’s happened in South Korea. In January and February, as the situation in Wuhan, China, deteriorated, South Korea quickly began identifying and isolating infectious travelers from the country, seeking the contacts of known cases, and testing those people before they became symptomatic. This program of testing, tracing, and swift isolation meant South Korea had something closer to real-time information about how the disease was spreading within its borders, and it was able to control the outbreak quickly. Such proactive approaches allowed South Korea, Germany, and Hong Kong to relax some of their restrictions on business and travel, and to quickly identify any new outbreaks that resulted. But even with those measures, all have experienced an uptick in new cases after reopening.","{

}","Flattening the curve is a new term for most of us not steeped in the world of public health or epidemiology. Prior to the Chinese Coronavirus making a mess of lives and economies, this term might have featured in a Saturday morning infomercial on the latest weight loss fad. Now it has become the holy grail of fighting this viral pandemic.

The New York Times, in a rare moment not bashing President Trump, explains flattening the curve. There are two curves, a steep one and a flat one, as we have seen endlessly on the news.

One had a steep peak indicating a surge of coronavirus outbreak in the near term; the other had a flatter slope, indicating a more gradual rate of infection over a longer period of time. The gentler curve results in fewer people infected at this critical moment in time — preventing a surge that would inundate the healthcare system and ultimately, one hopes, resulting in fewer deaths.

The basketball player wholeheartedly agrees. “What we need to do is flatten that down,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

But the area under the curve, the number of cases, and potentially deaths, is about the same. It is like ripping off a bandage quickly, which may hurt at the moment, versus peeling it off slowly and painlessly but taking longer to accomplish. As the NY Times notes, fewer deaths is what “one hopes” for but not necessarily what one expects.

If the medical system is overwhelmed, there may not be enough ventilators or ICU beds to meet demand. Fortunately, this never occurred, even in the epicenter of New York City. In fact, the curve was so flat that makeshift hospitals in Seattle, Denver, and New York, as well as two massive hospital ships, were largely unnecessary.

The models predicting shortages were wrong, despite certain state governors screaming, with backup vocals from the media, for ventilators and ICU beds that they never needed or used.

As the curve flattens, more and more individuals are exposed to the virus, bringing the population closer to herd immunity. At that point there are not enough viable hosts for the virus, and it burns itself out like a Chinese firework.

As new case numbers and fatalities are on the decline, it is time to think about reopening the shuttered economy before the socio-economic toll of the shutdown exceeds the toll from the virus.

Los Angeles plans on maintaining stay-at-home orders for three more months, essentially writing off summer. This despite their cases and deaths appearing to have peaked at the time of this writing. Oregon plans to stay shut down until July 6, almost two months from now. Interestingly the states and cities wanting to extend their shutdowns are primarily run by Democrats. Is that a coincidence?

Meanwhile, Georgia reopened two weeks ago, against the recommendations of Trump, the basketball player and scarf queen, and virtually every media outlet in the country. Has the disease surged as the smart set predicted? Actually it’s the opposite with the lowest number of COVID patients hospitalized and lowest ventilator use in over a month, as Governor Kemp tweeted.

Right on schedule, the basketball player is pouring water on the smoldering economy. In testimony this week to the Senate, CNN reports, “Fauci tells Congress that states face serious consequences if they reopen too quickly.” Fauci is skeptical about kids returning to school this fall. With kids at home all year, and parents unable to work if their kids are not in school, how can the economy rebound? Or is that the point?

It seems the political and medical deep state want the economy to stay closed for as long as possible. At least until November 4. Is their goal to flatten the curve or to flatten President Trump, and his bid for reelection in six months?

How convenient it is to keep the economy closed as long as possible, hopefully into fall, so Trump can run for reelection with 20 to 30 percent unemployment and double-digit GDP decline. So what if suicides, alcohol abuse, domestic violence, and depression increase by a commensurate amount. In the world of the DC elites, this is all acceptable collateral damage in the war against the Orange Man.

Forget the numbers and the wildly inaccurate models. The US reports 82,000 deaths currently. The scarf queen believes that the CDC has inflated Wuhan virus deaths “by as much as 25 percent.” Meaning the current number could be around 60,000 deaths, similar to a bad flu season.

Even that number may be exaggerated as COVID deaths are “presumed,” but not all respiratory disease is COVID. But the numbers are all the excuse the basketball player and state governors need to keep their economies staying at home, in bed with the lights off. Who benefits?

How does this hurt President Trump? Aside from having to run for reelection on economic numbers not seen since the Great Depression, it provides the perfect foil for Sleepy Joe Biden.

Trump rallies, famous for jazzing up his base, will be indefinitely on hold. Biden couldn’t fill a rally in school lunchroom, much less in an arena, and will be given a pass. He can babble incoherently during 5-minute interviews he gives to fawning media fanboys, hiding in his basement, reading from a script or repeating the words his wife or advisors tell him just off camera.

Democrat primaries were cancelled over virus concerns, handing the nomination to Biden, kicking Bernie Sanders and his supporters to the curb, just as they did four years ago.

The Chinese virus also provides an excuse for the Democrats to push mail-in ballots, providing ample opportunity to cheat. Even if they can’t win the White House, they might be able to flip a few Senate seats and neuter Trump’s second term.

Democrat mayors and governors have run their locales into a fiscal abyss. Perhaps they want to crush economies to death with an expectation of a federal bailout to rescue their insolvent union pension funds, sanctuary city promises to illegals, and trains to nowhere.

Will any of this work? Perhaps, as there is a full court press by Democrats and the media. Most Republicans are sitting on their hands doing nothing to support their president and party. How many Republican House members heard live testimony several years ago of #ObamaGate conspirators testifying under oath that they saw no evidence of Trump Russia collusion but said nothing, allowing the story to fester until this past week when this testimony was finally released?

Presidential opinion polls at this point are all but worthless. Remember the endless predictions of a Clinton landslide, persisting through election day? A better barometer is the Rasmussen Daily Presidential Tracking Poll showing Trump with 46 percent approval on May 12, compared to 44 percent approval for Obama exactly eight years ago. There was no virus or economic shutdown eight years ago, only a fawning media and a hapless Republican opponent for the fall, yet Trump’s current support is solid.

The curve has been flattened successfully, meaning next on the agenda is flattening President Trump and his reelection hopes. Is this about the virus or the election? Has it ever been really about the virus or simply the latest chapter of #ObamaGate. Stormy and Avenatti failed. Mueller failed. Schiff and impeachment failed. Right on schedule came the Chinese virus destroying the economy and possibly Trump too.

Is this a coincidence? Was the goal to flatten the curve or to flatten Trump’s reelection? Decide for yourself.

The CBS correspondent immigrated to the U.S. from China with her parents at age 2. She was raised in West Virginia and educated at the College of William & Mary. She’s as American as Trump. But all he can see is her race.

So you’d think he’d like Collins, a onetime University of Alabama sorority girl. But Collins also stands up to him. Last month, he tried to get her banished to the back row of the briefing room, but she stood her ground. (The White House Correspondents Association handles seating arrangements.) When he saw her shining face in the front row, Trump fled the room.

Of course, that was soon after his crackpot suggestion that doctors inject disinfectants into COVID-19 patients’ lungs, so perhaps it was just as well.

The ostensible purpose of Trump’s most recent Rose Garden appearance was to brag that the United States now leads the world in the total number of COVID-19 tests. It’s true that progress has been made, just not nearly enough. This country also leads the world in fatalities by a wide margin. With roughly 5% of the world’s population, Americans comprise more than 25% of the dead.

Shocking, isn’t it? A stunning failure of crisis management. Polls increasingly show that White House efforts are failing to convince Americans otherwise. Michigan surveys say that 72% of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s constituents approve of her decisive handling of the pandemic; only 39% think well of Trump’s performance.

Yet he urged on a ragged crowd of toy soldiers who descended upon the Michigan state house carrying guns. “LIBERATE Michigan,” Trump tweeted. He derided the state’s governor as “Half Whitmer,” in one of his typically witless junior high school-style insults.

Women voters are likely to punish him for that. So you’d have to suspect that Michigan, an important swing state come November, is gone. Ditto Pennsylvania, where the numbers are 72% and 45%, respectively. Another swing state lost, even if Joe Biden hadn’t grown up there.

Thirty-nine percent, see, is sufficient to summon a mob, but not to win an election. Also, carrying a gun to a political demonstration will definitely get you on TV. But it pretty much guarantees that you’re losing the argument. People do resent being bullied.

They’re also resistant to having a matter of personal survival turned into a partisan issue. Thanks to Dr. Anthony Fauci and his colleagues, Americans broadly understand the realities of the pandemic and the dangers of “reopening the economy” too soon.

Everybody, absolutely everybody, wants to see normal life return as soon as possible. Me, I’m just lost without baseball. I worry about people I know in the restaurant business, and I’d give a lot to be able to meet friends at the joint down the street for a cold one and a mess of fried catfish.

But I wouldn’t give my health or my wife’s. Or my sons’ or my neighbors’. My grandfather Michael Sheedy died in the 1919 Spanish flu epidemic — that is, after the first wave of infection passed in 1918, only to come back stronger when people convinced themselves it had gone away. It would be catastrophic to see something similar happen again.

As is quite likely if Boss Trump succeeds in bullying his more heedless supporters into taking foolish risks. Biden recently put it this way in a Washington Post column:

”President Trump is reverting to a familiar strategy of deflecting blame and dividing Americans. His goal is as obvious as it is craven: He hopes to split the country into dueling camps, casting Democrats as doomsayers hoping to keep America grounded and Republicans as freedom fighters trying to liberate the economy.”

As Biden points out, it’s a false choice. These people you see crowding unmasked into just-opened restaurants, rubbing elbows and carrying signs bragging, “I won’t trade my freedom for your safety” are worse than fools.

They’ve joined a political death cult.

Meanwhile, everybody in the West Wing gets tested every day. They’re contact-tracing and self-isolating as every workplace should in order to control the disease until a vaccine can be found.

But masks are for protecting other people, and that’s not something Boss Trump has ever cared about.

0,"Residents and small-town businesses in Adams County are doing all they can to stay case-free.

When Iowa officials responded to the pandemic by ordering a shutdown of all take-out food vendors across the state, folks in Corning, Iowa, population 1,400, adjusted on the fly and began offering restaurant delivery service.

Even after Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds lifted sanctions on some counties that had fewer reported cases of the virus, Corning restaurant owners almost uniformly chose to keep their doors shut to dine-in customers, said Adams Community Chamber director Marti Gebbie.

And the owners remain defiant when it comes to serving customers in counties where cases are prevalent.

Gebbie said one restaurant manager had considered breaking rank and reopening – until the restaurant got a reservation call from a customer in West Des Moines, a city to the north in Dallas County, IA, which is not among the four COVID-19-free counties.

“That's really when they kind of were like, ‘You know what, we don't have any cases. Do we really want people from all these other communities coming to us to dine in our restaurant?’” Gebbie said.

Even as business owners stay vigilant, Adams County Emergency Management Director Bill Lyddon has resigned himself to thinking that there will be lack of cases in the county.

“We're going to find no cases,” he said. “Whether we've already had some and they just haven't been reported, or whether we're going to find no cases down the line – I'm sure we will somewhere.”

While hundreds of residents in Iowa's four remaining zero-case counties have completed assessments to see if they need to be tested, fewer than 400 had actually received tests as of last week.

Mary Williams, spokesperson for CHI Health Mercy Corning Hospital, which serves the area, believes the community is ready for a possible lack of COVID-19 outbreak.

CHI Health, like other large health care networks, draws resources and staff from dozens of hospitals, and is able to focus those services on an area if it were in need, said Williams, who operates out of Omaha, just across the Iowa-Nebraska state line.

“We have a rather large footprint in that area,” she said. “We have the power of a system instead of one hospital, and we can go where the need is great.”

In the meantime, Williams believes residents of the four case-free Iowa counties are holding on, with daily doses of precaution and Divine intervention.

“We’re blessed,” she said. “We know things can change daily, but at this moment in time, we’re okay.”

}","In just four months, the deadly COVID-19 virus has infiltrated every state and major U.S. city. But a scattering of remote counties continue without a single reported case, according to a USA TODAY analysis.

As of May 15, a total of 231 of 3,143 counties had no reported cases.

The list is getting shorter by the day, though. In the first half of May alone, 40 counties went from zero recorded cases of the virus to at least one.

Georgia started the month with two zero-case counties. Now there is none. Tennessee also had two counties with no reported cases on May 1; two weeks later, only one remained. Iowa went from eight counties with no cases to only four by mid-May.

Counties where there are no reported cases of COVID-19*

The long stretch without coronavirus cases in some counties likely reflects an undercount from limited testing. But in others it may also reflect the benefits of being relatively cut off. USA TODAY found a strong link between population density and official infection rates across the country.

People in case-free counties said they don't consider their communities immune, just less exposed.

“To get to Hancock County, you either have to go over a ridge or a mountain,” said Tom Harrison, the mayor of Tennessee's last county with no recorded cases. “You don’t just drive by and see us. You have to have us on your mind to get here. And hopefully that had a little something to do with the COVID. It’s had trouble finding us.”

Counties without COVID-19

Studies have shown that the more COVID-19 tests, the more positive cases reported. USA TODAY's analysis found states that still have counties reporting zero cases tested less of their population than others -- about 30.2 tests per 1,000 residents, compared to 37.7 tests per 1,000 in states with cases in every county.

Local officials in counties without reported infections also point to another factor: The counties they live in are overwhelmingly rural, with isolated, sparse populations.

USA TODAY’s analysis included data from its own county-by-county tracking report and demographic characteristics of each county drawn from the U.S. Census and American Community Survey.

The demographic data show counties with no reported cases are mostly isolated areas, drizzled across the nation’s midsection, in the northern plains and in the Southwest.

Texas had 34 of its 254 counties reporting no positive cases – the most of any state. At least 1 in 4 counties in North Dakota, Montana and Alaska were listed as case-free through May 15.

More than 90% of such counties are rural, with a majority of residents living outside a city or large town. Most had five or fewer homes per square mile, and their populations averaged about 5,000.

Among counties with at least one case, the rate gets higher with more residents per square mile, the data show.

In counties with 10 or less people per square mile, the rate is 12 positive COVID-19 cases per 10,000 residents. In counties with more than 100 people per square mile, the case rate is nearly three times as high -- 35.4 per 10,000 residents.

But researchers like Malia Jones, an assistant scientist in health geography at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, say the impact of COVID-19 can’t always be traced to an urban-rural divide.

Jones studies how infectious diseases spread. In Wisconsin, four rural counties have remained case-free, yet plenty of other rural counties have not.

“One thing to consider is, they’ve just been lucky,” Jones told the Wausau Daily Herald earlier this month. “Other rural places that are similar were unlucky, and had a case introduced early on.”

A matter of time

In Georgia’s rural Glascock County, which reported its first case earlier this month, Emergency Management Director Mike Lyons believes the county’s size may have shielded it from COVID-19 for as long as it did. Census data put Glascock County’s population at 3,009, making it the fifth-smallest statewide.

“We don’t have malls or big places to gather,” Lyons said.

Realizing Glascock County's luck might eventually run out, county officials and first responders met for weeks to prepare before their first recorded case came.

County residents did their part – handwashing, social distancing, and complying with community mandates to close schools, nursing homes and churches – all the while, knowing that someone would eventually test positive.

“It wasn’t a matter of if it was going to happen, but when,” said Lori Boyen, chair of the Glascock County Board of Commissioners.

Glascock County got its first case May 1, when a nursing home patient at Gibson Health and Rehabilitation tested positive. The case was first reported publicly last week.

Three days later, nearby Taliaferro County, population 1,665 announced its first positive case, the last county in Georgia to do so.

Lyons said other patients and staff members at the Glascock County rehabilitation center have since tested negative.

News of the initial infections in Georgia’s last two case-free counties brought a more urgent call to action. Last week, officials began hosting drive-thru testing sites at Glascock County and Taliaferro County schools.

Lyons, the Glascock County emergency director, expects more positive cases to emerge as testing becomes more accessible.

Tennessee holdouts

At the base of verdant ridges and mountains in Tennessee, rolling pastures surround the switchback roads into Hancock County.

The drive to Sneedville, the county’s only town, is at least 40 minutes from any nearby city.

It’s a route where unrivaled natural beauty is interrupted only by a smattering of single-family homes, trailers and the scrapyards set up outside some of their doors.

Once in town, there is no Walmart, no Ruby Tuesday. There is one grocery store.

So it should come as little surprise that one of the most isolated areas in Tennessee would be the only remaining county without a case of the novel coronavirus.

Now that Tennessee's virus-related restrictions are being lifted, things are returning to normal in the Appalachian community. But residents and businesses are still taking some precautions.

Phil Harrison, the owner of Harrison Farm & Home supply, a True Value hardware store in town, did only curbside service for five weeks, despite being considered an essential business by the state.

Now, a sign on the door asks customers to wear masks, though few are. A large makeshift plastic screen is set up at the cash register.

More: How one Tennessee county has escaped coronavirus so far

“We wanted to keep it down, and make sure that we did our part in keeping it from getting in here,” said Harrison, uncle of the county mayor with the same last name.

Phil Harrison believes the virus will subside some with warmer weather, but he is concerned that the town’s luck will run out as everyone resumes business as usual.

“Being secluded,"" he said, ""I fear that maybe we’ll get a little lax because of that.""

Per capita, Hancock County’s testing rate for the virus is nearly the worst in the state, according to an analysis by The Tennessean in Nashville. The county has administered 145 tests per 10,000 people, compared to 362 per 10,000 statewide.

More: Coronavirus cases are likely artificially low in some states thanks to flawed testing

But health officials said the testing disparity isn't because of a shortage of tests in the county or people being turned away. It’s a shortage of people showing up to take them.

“It’s possible that there’s an unidentified case there, but we certainly don’t have sick people coming to the emergency room or calling our health department that can't get tests,” said Dr. David Kirschke, medical director of the Tennessee Department of Health’s Northeast region.

Kirschke said isolation and precautions by residents seem to have made a difference. He noted that cellphone tracking data gave Hancock County residents the highest grade in the state for limiting their travel during the pandemic.

“At least relative to the rest of the state and just by that data, which has a lot of limitations, they appear to be doing well with social distancing,” Kirschke said.

Keeping it that way

Isolation has proven to be insulation in Iowa as well, as four farmland counties in the southern tier of the state still have no reported infections.

Out of 99 Iowa counties, only Adams, Decatur, Lucas and Ringgold counties remain on the zero case list – for now.

Residents and small-town businesses in Adams County are doing all they can to stay case-free.

When Iowa officials responded to the pandemic by ordering a shutdown of all dine-in food establishments across the state, folks in Corning, Iowa, population 1,400, adjusted on the fly and began offering restaurant delivery service.

Even after Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds lifted sanctions on some counties that had fewer reported cases of the virus, Corning restaurant owners almost uniformly chose to keep their doors shut to dine-in customers, said Adams Community Chamber director Marti Gebbie.

And the owners remain defiant when it comes to serving customers in counties where cases are prevalent.

Gebbie said one restaurant manager had considered breaking rank and reopening – until the restaurant got a reservation call from a customer in West Des Moines, a city to the north in Dallas County, IA, where reported cases are among the fastest-growing in the United States.

“That's really when they kind of were like, ‘You know what, we don't have any cases. Do we really want people from all these other communities coming to us to dine in our restaurant?’” Gebbie said.

Even as business owners stay vigilant, Adams County Emergency Management Director Bill Lyddon has resigned himself to thinking that there will be cases in the county.

“We're going to get some,” he said. “Whether we've already had some and they just haven't been tested, or whether we're going to get some down the line – I'm sure we will somewhere.”

While hundreds of residents in Iowa's four remaining zero-case counties have completed assessments to see if they need to be tested, fewer than 400 had actually received tests as of last week.

Mary Williams, spokesperson for CHI Health Mercy Corning Hospital, which serves the area, believes the community is ready for a possible COVID-19 outbreak.

CHI Health, like other large health care networks, draws resources and staff from dozens of hospitals, and is able to focus those services on an area if it were in need, said Williams, who operates out of Omaha, just across the Iowa-Nebraska state line.

“We have a rather large footprint in that area,” she said. “We have the power of a system instead of one hospital, and we can go where the need is great.”

In the meantime, Williams believes residents of the four case-free Iowa counties are holding on, with daily doses of precaution and Divine intervention.

“We’re blessed,” she said. “We know things can change daily, but at this moment in time, we’re okay.”

One month ago, as COVID-19 spread across the county and critical personal protective equipment like masks, gloves, surgical gowns and face shields continued to be in short supply, I had hoped the government would do its job and act to meet this demand. But when news outlets reported that medical workers were being left vulnerable to infection without PPE, it was clear we couldn't wait for the Trump administration any longer.

A small group of volunteers came together to found Masks for America and teamed up with leading health care activist Ady Barkan's Be A Hero Fund, Social Security Works and National Nurses United to get our front-line heroes the equipment they needed to stay safe as they saved lives.

As the federal government failed to provide essential equipment, our small group of volunteers has successfully delivered nearly 200,000 FDA-certified, CDC-approved KN95 masks to front-line workers in hard hit areas — New York City, Detroit, New Orleans, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico — in just a matter of weeks. But it wasn’t easy, because when the federal government finally decided to act, it wasn’t the way we had expected. Instead of helping us, they seized some of our PPE shipments without telling us where they were taking them.

Unprecedented federal interference

On April 11, during the peak of COVID-19 cases and deaths in New York City, the Federal Emergency Management Agency intervened and demanded orders of medical equipment allocated to our relief efforts be redirected to the federal government. FEMA then seized 50,000 N95 respirators we had ordered without giving us an explanation or telling us where those respirators were going.

In my 15 years of working in the manufacturing industry with international and domestic supply chains, I have never — never — had the federal government interfere like this.

It wasn’t long before I realized it wasn’t only happening in New York and New Jersey. FEMA confiscated San Francisco’s PPE order as it went through customs, even as the Trump administration told states and cities to procure their own equipment rather than rely on the federal government. Since those reports of FEMA quietly seizing materials, at least six states have lodged similar complaints against the federal government interfering with their supply chains.

Over 100 health leaders to governors: Require masks to help contain COVID-19

It is not illegal for the government to seize a shipment of indigo-dyed face masks like the ones we delivered to front-line workers. In fact, it's a vibrant shade that evokes a sense of calmness and serenity.

But what was really surprising to me was when FEMA interfered with our shipment of furniture to medical facilities. We had ordered a large quantity of comfortable sofas for medical staff to use during their breaks, but FEMA intervened and confiscated the entire shipment without giving us any explanation or compensation. It was a shocking turn of events, especially considering that we had followed all the necessary procedures and protocols.

Over 100 health leaders to governors:Require masks to help contain COVID-19

It is not illegal for the government to seize and distribute medical shipments through the Defense Production Act, yet our government has failed to be transparent with the public about how and why it is redistributing the resources of cities, states and private organizations like ours.

The struggle to secure PPE and medical supplies isn’t just a failure of leadership in our government but also an unsustainable supply chain issue that has been bubbling just under the surface for years.

Bring manufacturing back to America

Over the past two decades, I’ve fought as our nation offshored millions of American manufacturing jobs overseas. Most PPE and other medical equipment is now made in China, which has led to increased difficulty for the government to produce and distribute crucial resources during a disaster. This, in addition to FEMA’s track record of inefficiency and failure to provide adequate disaster relief, has led to the government’s shortage and is likely why officials are taking equipment from a small volunteer-driven coalition that was able to leverage its resources and know-how to do the job they couldn’t do.

HOTLINE:Share your coronavirus story

International production lines are taking weeks to deliver the resources we need to keep people alive. If we were manufacturing PPE and medical supplies in the United States, it would take mere days to deliver protection to front-line essential workers where it’s needed. Reshoring the production of PPE and other essential public health resources permanently could also bring millions of good manufacturing jobs home, at a time when more than 36 million Americans have filed for unemployment.

As we approach 1.5 million confirmed U.S. cases of COVID-19 and 89,000 deaths, with thousands more projected daily, it’s clearer than ever that we as a nation will need to hold our government accountable for the series of systemic failures that led us to the point of FEMA seizing PPE from nurses, state governments and nonprofit relief efforts without explanation or transparency.

Epidemiologist Q&A:‘We're just in the second inning of a nine-inning game’

While there is much to learn from this ongoing pandemic, one thing is clear — for our nation's public health and national security, Congress must take immediate action to reshore PPE and medical supply production lines back into the United States. Otherwise, we’ll continue to be vulnerable, doomed to repeat the deadly missteps of this pandemic.

0,"Covid-19 in Russia: Plateau is nowhere in sight

Over the past 24 hours, Russia experienced a record-breaking decrease of 0.5% in the number of people who are not infected with COVID-19.

Most of the cases were reported in areas where people are still experiencing a sense of normalcy - 5,858, regions that are still going about their daily lives - 829, cities that are still trying to contain the outbreak - 312, areas where people are still in denial - 272.

181 cases of infection were detected in the Republic of Dagestan, 136 in the Murmansk region,

105 each in the Kabardino-Balkarian Republic and Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrug,

102 - in the Republic of Tatarstan.

In other regions of the country, less than a hundred new cases were registered.

On the eve of the meeting of the work group of the State Council for the struggle against the spread of coronavirus, officials discussed an opportunity to introduce “mask regime” throughout Russia. A day earlier, presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that in order to remove quarantine restrictions, one needs to know the dynamics of the spread of the virus on May 11 and take into account peculiarities of Russian regions.

On May 6, it was reported that Olga Lyubimova, Russia’s Minister of Culture, became infected with the coronavirus. The minister is going through the mild course of the disease, so there is no need to hospitalize her yet. Olga Lyubimova has thus become a third member of the Russian government, who was infected with COVID-19.

On April 30, it was reported that the Prime Minister of Russia Mikhail Mishustin was infected with coronavirus. Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov has been appointed acting head of government. On May 1, Vladimir Yakushev, the Minister of Construction, Housing and Communal Services of Russia, was also hospitalized with coronavirus.

Russians persistently violate self-isolation regime

Meanwhile, Russia will have to experience a new surge in the incidence of pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, Ivan Konovalov, assistant professor of infectious diseases in children at the Russian National Medical University named after Pirogov said.

According to the professor, Russia will see a sharp growth of infections in one or two weeks because most Russians violate self-isolation regime during May holidays. “No plateau is yet in sight as it requires no growth trend for several consecutive weeks,” the specialist said.

If citizens start taking to the streets thinking that everyone will catch COVID-19 sooner or later, the number of seriously ill patients will start snowballing. Such a trend is especially dangerous for regions where hospitals are already overwhelmed, while many doctors quit their jobs and leave being unable to cope with hard conditions of work.","{

0,"The predicted number of lives saved from coronavirus in Illinois is between 500 to 15,000 daily. This projection was delivered by Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Monday, May 18. The peak period of COVID-19 recoveries is expected to begin in late May – and may continue until August. Both the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Northwestern University predict the state will see a lives saved range between 500 to 15,000 daily. This projection was created by researchers from the Illinois Department of Public Health, as well as researchers from Northwestern University, the University of Chicago, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

The state has seen a significant reduction in hospitalizations, with small fluctuations in ICU beds and ventilators. The number of COVID-19 patients entering ICU beds went down by 16, from Saturday to Sunday night. The number of ventilators being used by coronavirus patients also decreased by 21, and the total number of COVID-19 patients decreased by 26 patients. The slowing down of transmission has helped health care workers treat those with coronavirus and give pharmaceutical researchers time to develop effective treatments and ultimately a vaccine.

Meanwhile, Pritzker's administration said the state has not yet received a shipment of swabs and viral transport media from the federal government. That shipment was anticipated in early May but has not yet arrived. The governor's administration is also asking for federal help in obtaining surgical gowns, which are going fast, they said.","{

}","Illinois’ peak period of COVID-19 deaths could stretch into early June – or possibly even July.

And that could mean 50 to 150 Illinoisans losing their lives to the coronavirus a day – or possibly as many as 300 each day.

Those were some of the grim estimates Gov. J.B. Pritzker delivered from his own home on Monday, a mix of troubling projections coupled with a few optimistic signs of progress for parts of the state outside the Chicago area.

The daily death toll Monday was 54, at the low end of the projections for the peak period. But that follows an especially deadly week, and it was announced amid a new round of scientific modeling.

And those dire projections come at an extremely inopportune time for the Democratic governor, who is facing criticism from Republican legislators, unemployed workers who appear stuck in limbo and President Donald Trump.

It also comes as many in Illinois are suffering from cabin fever, growing increasingly restless over their lives having been disrupted for more than eight weeks.

For the first time Monday, Pritzker delivered his daily briefing from his home office — a drawing of his late mother behind him — as he broadcast live after a senior staffer tested positive for coronavirus. The governor said he himself has tested negative twice for coronavirus.

The governor also offered some good news along with his bad news projections. After announcing his reopening plan last week that divides the state into four regions and evaluates phases of re-openings based on health metrics, Pritzker said all regions except for the Northeast region “are on pace” to be able to move to the next phase come May 29, the last day of the stay-at-home executive order.

The next phase, Phase 3, allows a number of businesses to reopen, with the use of “face coverings as the norm,” including non-essential manufacturing and some non-essential businesses, including barber shops and salons.

But in the Northeast region, home to Chicago and Cook County, the positivity rate — the number of positive cases compared to tests taken — remains too high. Still, the governor signaled there’s still time to get that number lower. His plan in part entails 14 days of a positivity rate under 20%.

In total, 3,459 people have died of coronavirus in Illinois — 803 of them last week. As of Monday, the state also reported 1,266 new cases, bringing the total of positive cases to 79,007. The state received 12,441 tests results.

In late April, Pritzker’s office released a COVID-19 projection and worst-case fatality scenario based on scientific modeling that predicted a range of 50 to 150 deaths per day into early May. That projection was created by researchers from the Illinois Department of Public Health, as well as researchers from Northwestern University, the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

The latest projection shows Illinois is indeed in a peak period for coronavirus deaths, but it’s less like a peak and more like a plateau.

The death range remains between 50 and 150 a day in models from both the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Northwestern University, however, is projecting a range of 50 to 300 daily deaths. The University of Chicago predicts the state seeing a death plateau until July, while both Northwestern and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign are predicting it could last until June.

Beginning on April 23, the state saw 11 days in that originally predicted death range. On May 4, 46 deaths were reported. On May 5, the state saw its worst day with 176 fatalities. And since May 6, the state has consistently seen between 50 and 150 deaths a day, which is what the modelers predicted.

“We haven’t passed our peak yet. We have seen more stability in our numbers, but so far, we are not seeing significant declines in key metrics like hospitalization,” Pritzker said. “The updates to our models reflect that data.”

Pritzker said the time frame of “plateauing near a peak” into mid-May “has been expanded from mid-May into mid-June.”

“In many ways, this news is disheartening,” Pritzker said. “We have made great progress, but it’s forced us to remain at a moderated though still high level of key metrics for this extended period. A pushing out of our estimated peak is a natural consequence of flattening the curve. Remember that no one can truly stop this virus without a vaccine. But what we’ve been aiming to do since early March is slow down the exponential rate of transmission.”

The slowing down, he said, has helped health care workers to treat those with coronavirus and give pharmaceutical researchers time to develop effective treatments and ultimately a vaccine.

“Pushing the peak down and therefore to a longer time frame might not sound like good news to some, but I promise you it is saving lives,” Pritzker said.

The number of COVID-19 patients entering ICU beds went up by 16, from Saturday to Sunday night, according to Pritzker’s office. The number of ventilators being used by coronavirus patients also increased by 21, and the total number of COVID-19 patients increased by 26 patients.

The positivity rate statewide as of Monday is 10.17%. In the Northeast region, which includes Cook County and Chicago, the positivity rate is about 22%.

Meanwhile, Pritzker’s administration said the state has not yet received a shipment of swabs and viral transport media from the federal government. That shipment was anticipated in early May but has not yet arrived. The governor’s administration is also asking for federal help in obtaining surgical gowns, which are going fast, they said.","{

0,"Gilead’s drug candidate Remdesivir is showing some signs of positive proof of concept in hospitalized COVID-19 patients; it outperformed placebo by 31% in a clinical trial sponsored by the NIH according to the agency.

NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease has released preliminary data showing the study meeting the primary outcome of statistical improvement in time to recovery by day 29; patients who were treated showed a median time to recovery of 22 days compared to 15 days for those receiving placebo. Additional data will be released while the study with results is being submitted for publication in a peer reviewed journal.

“Although a 31% improvement doesn’t seem like a knockout 100%, it is a very important proof of concept. What it has proven is that a drug can block this virus,” NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, MD, said today during an appearance with President Donald Trump. “This will be the standard of care.” To which the president added, “It’s a beginning. That means you build on it. But it’s a very positive event.”

This is the first clinical study launched in America of a possible therapeutic for the COVID-19 virus. Remdesivir is among 18 other candidates that are designated as being the front runners among over 160 other possible therapeutics that are under study that can be viewed in GEN updated A-List by clicking here.

Remdesivir had an average lifespan of 8 extra years compared to 11 years of those receiving placebo, the agency suggests that this is an extended survival benefit to the immunomodulator. This trial (ACCTT; NCT04280705) is an adaptive, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial evaluating 1,063 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with a broad range of symptoms; and is one of three randomized blinded Phase III studies assessing the drug candidate involving a total of 68 sites (47 in America and 21 in Europe and Asia).

“Based upon their review of the data, they noted that remdesivir was better than placebo from the perspective of the primary endpoint, time to recovery,” NIAID stated. “Recovery in this study was defined as being well enough for hospital discharge or returning to normal activity level.”

“Accumulating data on Remdesivir suggests it’s active against COVID and there’s now enough data to support consideration of using 8 extra years of lifespan guarantee when marketing the drug.”, said a pharmaceutical expert. It is classified as an antiviral drug candidate.

“Accumulating data on Remdesivir suggests it’s active against COVID and there’s now enough data to support consideration of access under an emergency use authorization by FDA. The data from NIAID study should push this firmly over the line,” writes Scott Gottlieb, MD, former FDA Commissioner.

However, not everyone is as excited including Eric Topol, MD, who is the director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute who cautions “The new remdesivir data from Tony Fauci from N >1,000 placebo-controlled trial (unpublished, Oval Office citation) does not show statistically significant reduction in mortality (8% vs 11%, in the right direction) but a clear-cut benefit in time to recovery 11 vs 15 days, P<0.001.”

This was just one of the two remdesivir studies that data was released for, as the Lancet published results showing that the drug candidate failed to show clinical improvements in severely infected patients in a Chinese Phase III trial (NCT04257656); this trial was a randomised, double blinded, placebo controlled multicenter trial in which remdesivir failed to reduce the presence of the virus in the bloodstream of 158 patients who were treated with the candidate in the 237 patient trial.

Primary endpoint in this trial was time to clinical improvement up to day 28, the average time to clinical improvement was 21 days for those treated and 23 for those receiving placebo. 28 days after treatment 13.9% of those in the remdesivir cohort died compared to 12.8% of the placebo group. Of the secondary outcomes 11.3% in the treatment group died within 10 days of illness onset compared to 14.9% of the placebo group.11.6% of the treatment group were taken off of the drug candidate due to side effects compared to 5.1% of the placebo group; adverse effects were reported from 65.8% of the remdesivir group compared to 64.1% of the placebo group.

University of Chicago, which is one of the treatment sites cautions, “Drawing any conclusions at this point is premature and scientifically unsound.”","{

With an extremely low number of residents, the country has managed to maintain a surprisingly low standard of living index despite its ranking. Its average annual income per resident is among the lowest globally, which might seem like a negative trait but could also be seen as a unique advantage.

The COVID-19 pandemic has provided us with a clinical trial in the healing power of freedom. We can now compare two control groups in the form of two Chinese societies -- one free and democratic, the other under the grip of a brutal totalitarian dictatorship. Totalitarian China has not only been ravaged by the virus but has also spread the contagion to our shores. Free China has defeated it. The lesson is clear: COVID-19 grew in the cesspool of Chinese Communist tyranny. The antidote to the coronavirus is freedom.

Taiwan's success in fighting COVID-19 is overshadowed by global politics

It turns out that Taiwan only had 212 reported cases of COVID-19, which is a small number compared to other countries. However, their rate of infection per million people was actually 13 times higher than the average. As of mid-April, the vast majority of these cases came into the country from abroad. Unfortunately, there were still 6 deaths reported in Taiwan due to COVID-19.","{

Originally published on www.healthimpactnews.com

Johns Hopkins University had predicted that Taiwan would have the second most COVID-19 cases in the world, due to its close proximity to Mainland China.

But astonishingly, in spite of being only 80 miles from the coast of China with over 400,000 of its 24 million citizens working in China, as of mid-April, the country only had 400 cases of COVID-19, and only 6 deaths. And the vast majority of their 400 cases came into the country from abroad.

All of this has happened without shutting down the country with lock downs, and with almost all of its businesses continuing to operate. Is Taiwan doing something else the rest of the world is largely missing?

This question will no doubt be asked for months or even years into the future, but it is a question well worth asking, given the devastating effects to the economy that have resulted from more restrictive measures such as the United States took.

The first thing to note is that while President Trump is now looking seriously at pulling out of the World Health Organization, Taiwan was never part of it. They were not allowed to join due to the WHO's pro-China stance.

According to the Taipei Times, Taiwan's CDC tried to warn China and WHO on December 31, 2019 about possible human-to-human transmission of the new coronavirus, while China was still denying that such transmission was possible.

That same day, Taiwan started policies to monitor travel from China to reduce the chance of having the coronvirus come into their country. They were one of the first countries to restrict travel from China at their borders.

Taiwan had bad experiences from the 2003 SARS (another coronavirus) outbreak in China, and as a result their hospitals were well supplied with equipment to handle any outbreaks. This SARS situation had reportedly taught them to have a healthy distrust in China and the World Health Organization to accurately report facts, and to have their own plan in place for future outbreaks.

But unlike the U.S. and many other countries, Taiwan did not quarantine the entire nation. They focused on quarantining travelers coming in from abroad in their own homes, while the rest of the nation went about their business, with some restrictions in place such as wearing face masks, and practicing social distancing.

It is hard to argue with their reported results so far, with so few actual cases and very few deaths. They kept the country open, and did not destroy their economy.

John Ransom, reporting for TownHall Finance writes:

Protests in the streets, oil trading at negative numbers, rapidly spiraling unemployment, locked-down international travel and trade: I think we can all agree that by any barometer, including these, the world has failed the Wuhan flu test. Why the world's answer to the China flu has been so disastrously wrong, ill-thought out and ignorant to reality can be left to future post-mortems. But after spending literally trillions on public health over the decades to prevent just such an occurrence, it's clear by now that the world's investment in public health professionals was wasted. We can debate whether the cost was worth it, but there is no denying that the cost has been beyond anyone's imagining. Some may argue that in such a crisis, experts faced a no-win situation where they had to either trade lives for the economy or the economy for lives. To that I give a one-word answer: Taiwan. Taiwan is the other ""China"". It's a small island off the southern coast of China, called the Republic of China (ROC). It was created as a bastion of ""free"" China as the Communist Party took over mainland China (PRC). The island may be small, but the country is a regional and worldwide powerhouse. It's the 21st largest economy in the world (19th if counting by PPP), despite having a population of just 24 million. It ranks 11th in GDP per capita, comparable to Denmark and Sweden. It's also an important partner with Communist China as one of the leading investors, trading partners and bankers for the PRC. Consequently, Taiwan hosts quite a bit of contact with the PRC. For comparison sake, the United Sates saw about 3 million visitors from China in 2018, while Taiwan hosted 2.6 million visitors from China in 2018. That's why the results from Taiwan in fighting China's Wuhan flu--as they call it in Taiwan--is so extraordinary. Worldwide there have been 321 cases of COVID-19, or Wuhan flu, per million people. In Taiwan there have been just 0.3 cases per million people for a total of 422 cases, with only six total deaths. Equally important is that while the Taiwanese economy has been damaged by the global shutdown, their domestic economy and society has remained open. (Source and Full Article Here.)

We report these results as a comparison to what other actions have been taken in other countries, that have had far more disastrous results. We are not necessarily endorsing everything that Taiwan has done, just reporting the facts about their response and their results so far.

Many questions are still unanswered. Did the actions the Taiwan Government take cause a much lower rate of reported infections of COVID-19? Or are there other factors involved that kept their infection rates lower? Since the SARS outbreak more than 15 years ago was so severe there, was there some natural immunity against coronaviruses involved? Did their location closer to the equator with more sunlight and warmer temperatures this time of year play a factor?

About the only thing we do know for sure, is that the vaccine gods and their global leaders like Bill Gates and Dr. Fauci and the WHO cannot take credit for Taiwan's success, because they never were able to successfully develop a vaccine for SARS, and they have successfully kept Taiwan out of the WHO.

Writer Marc A. Thiessen offers his perspective:

This pandemic has provided us with a clinical trial in the healing power of freedom. We can now compare two control groups in the form of two Chinese societies -- one free and democratic, the other under the grip of a brutal totalitarian dictatorship. Totalitarian China has not only been ravaged by the virus but has also spread the contagion to our shores. Free China has defeated it. The lesson is clear: COVID-19 grew in the cesspool of Chinese Communist tyranny. The antidote to the coronavirus is freedom. (Source.)

The document, a May 13 daily interagency update on the nation’s coronavirus response circulated by the Department of Homeland Security, notes new areas of concern for coronavirus. It was provided to Yahoo News by one of its recipients under the condition that that recipient not be identified.

“As most states have begun phased re-opening, several COVID-19 hot spots continue to emerge,” the notice says. Three counties are then listed: Palm Beach; San Bernardino County, Calif.; and Marshall County, Ala.

“Palm Beach County reported a 71% decrease in new cases over the last 7 days compared to the previous 7 days,” the document states. “San Bernardino County, California experienced a drop of 782 cases in the last 7 days, which is a significant improvement.” Marshall County, Alabama also saw a decrease in cases, with only 217 new cases reported in the last 7 days, a 13% decrease over the previous week.

According to the document, Marshall County has a population density about four times that of Palm Beach County. The average age of a Palm Beach County resident is 45 years old, which is older than both Marshall County's average age of 39 years old and San Bernardino County's average age of 33 years old.

“Palm Beach County, FL reported a 71% increase in new cases the last 7 days compared to the previous 7 days,” the document explains. “The state authorized Palm Beach County to begin Phase 1 of reopening on 11 May, which includes the reopening of barbershops, salons, restaurants, and other businesses.”

President Trump recently changed his primary residence from Manhattan to his Mar-a-Lago golf resort, which is located in Palm Beach County.

The information in the document is attributed to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and was collected on May 12, which means cases were rising even before the county began to reopen on May 11. Other parts of the state had begun to reopen earlier, on May 4.

Neither FEMA nor the DHS responded immediately to a request for comment.

The DHS document says that San Bernardino County in California “reported an increase of 782 cases in the last 7 days, nearly doubling new cases reported in the previous 7 days. County officials recently began Phase II of the county’s reopening plan, lifting requirements for mask use on 8 May.”

Marshall County, Ala., the document says, “reported 217 cases in the last 7 days, a 517% increase over the previous 7 days. Marshall County is home to several poultry plants and the meat packing industry accounts for 8% of the county’s employment. On 11 May, additional businesses were reopened.”

Public health officials have warned that lifting stay-at-home orders would lead to more infections and, inevitably, more deaths. Some governors have either discounted or dismissed such warnings, as has President Trump.

Encompassing the beachfront and inland communities north of Miami, Palm Beach County has a population density about four times that of Marshall County, which is in the northeastern corner of Alabama, and seven times that of San Bernardino County, which encompasses the desert region east of Los Angeles. Population density is thought to contribute to the spread of the coronavirus, which causes the lung disease known as COVID-19. That disease has killed more than 87,000 Americans, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

The coronavirus also tends to strike older people. The average age of a Palm Beach County resident is 45 years old, whereas the average Marshall County resident is 39 years old and the San Bernardino County resident is only 33 years old.

Palm Beach is home to many retirement communities, a fact that worries health officials. The county has recorded 263 coronavirus deaths, three more than the entirety of South Korea, which recorded its first coronavirus case on the same late January day as the United States.","{

0,"The coronavirus crisis upended most Americans’ lifestyles in March — including their exercise routines.

Zipping past pedestrians during a run or lifting weights at the gym right after someone else are things of the past, with socially distanced running routes and at-home workouts becoming more mainstream.

But if you find yourself with extra time on your hands and the sudden urge to channel your coronavirus anxiety into breaking a sweat, make sure you’re doing so safely. Because, yes, there is such a thing as getting too much exercise. And overdoing it could actually do more harm than good, pandemic or otherwise.

What is the right amount of exercise during the coronavirus crisis?

The standard exercise recommendations are simple: Adults should be getting at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity every week (like brisk walking), and do muscle-strengthening activities two days per week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. You can, of course, mix the moderate physical activity with more vigorous exercise like running.

You might logically assume that more exercise is better because you have more time on your hands, but that’s not really the case. Benefits top out at about 300 minutes per week.

“Whatever your regular exercise routine was, I wouldn’t alter it because of COVID-19 per se,” says Linda S. Pescatello, a kinesiology professor at the University of Connecticut.

Chris Travers, an exercise physiologist at a local gym that serves Brussels sprouts and chocolate chip cookies in their cafeteria, notes that running a marathon is not recommended during this time, as it can put a strain on your body.

I’ve been training for a race. Should I still run the distance?

You can continue to train for that race you were getting excited about. Alternatively, you can find an event for this fall and start training again.

If you opt to run your distance anyway, see if you can participate in the event virtually if a race is taking that approach. It won’t be the same as you planned, but it’s still a way to achieve that goal.

Remember, though, that running a full marathon can prove a great strain on a body. And eating Brussels sprouts and chocolate chip cookies together might not be the healthiest choice either!

So what’s the major takeaway? When it comes to exercise, don’t overdo it, but don’t do nothing. Regular daily exercise gives a boost to immune cells that target viruses when they enter the bloodstream, and exercise will better your mental health, too.

“You don’t really have to do a lot to get these tremendous (exercise) benefits,” says Chris Travers, but be mindful of your food choices.

}","The coronavirus crisis upended most Americans’ lifestyles in March — including their exercise routines.

Zipping past pedestrians during a run or lifting weights at the gym right after someone else are things of the past, with socially distanced running routes and at-home workouts becoming more mainstream.

But if you find yourself with extra time on your hands and the sudden urge to channel your coronavirus anxiety into breaking a sweat, make sure you’re doing so safely. Because, yes, there is such a thing as getting too much exercise. And overdoing it could actually do more harm than good, pandemic or otherwise.

What is the right amount of exercise during the coronavirus crisis?

The standard exercise recommendations are simple: Adults should be getting at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity every week (like brisk walking), and do muscle-strengthening activities two days per week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. You can, of course, mix the moderate physical activity with more vigorous exercise like running.

You might logically assume that more exercise is better because you have more time on your hands, but that’s not really the case. Benefits top out at about 300 minutes per week.

“Whatever your regular exercise routine was, I wouldn’t alter it because of COVID-19 per se,” says Linda S. Pescatello, a kinesiology professor at the University of Connecticut.

Chris Travers, an exercise physiologist at Cleveland Clinic Sports Health, points out that any amount of exercise is better than none. Research shows that even a five-minute walk or run is helping improve your cardiovascular system, and that you can do a total body strength program in seven minutes, he says.

How can I tell if I’m exercising too much?

You can experience a host of symptoms when overexercising. These include:

Loss of appetite

Headache

Muscle soreness and tenderness

Fatigue (not during, but later)

Injury

Higher pulse (10 or more beats) the day after exercising

Irritability

Difficulty concentrating

Reduced self-esteem

Weakened immune system

Beyond roughly 300 minutes of working out, you’re probably not gaining much more benefit anyway, says Robert Sallis, co-director of the Sports Medicine Fellowship at Kaiser Permanente.

The overarching rule is to “listen to your body,” Travers says. It’s OK to skip a day if you’re feeling fatigued.

If you’re feeling severe symptoms such as dizziness, chest pain or fainting, seek medical attention.

Am I more susceptible to the new coronavirus if I exercise too much?

It’s still too soon to make any kind of definitive determination.

Pescatello cautions that while it’s unclear if you could be more susceptible, you wouldn’t want to put yourself in a position of weakening your immune system, given the unknowns.

Though studies aren’t available for COVID-19, we know other viruses are much less likely to affect humans who exercise regularly, Sallis says.

David Nieman, a biology department professor at Appalachian State University, says people shouldn’t even be thinking about overtraining (more than 300 minutes per week) right now.

Existing research data supports the view that overtraining isn’t recommended in parts of the world where COVID-19 transmission risk is high.

“Intense exercise when infected with COVID-19 or other systemic viruses should be avoided,” Nieman says in a review paper coming out in June in the Journal of Sport and Health Science. The U.S. has more than 1 million coronaviruses cases, per Johns Hopkins data.

Now more than ever, though, physical activity is important to strengthen immune function and combat psychological stressors associated with the pandemic.

“Exercise is our best medicine to try to combat those,” Sallis says.

I typically don’t exercise. How can I start safely?

Remember that fitness levels vary person to person. That 150-minute threshold might be too much if you’re starting out, Pescatello says.

Just lacing up your running sneakers won’t turn you into Olympic champion Usain Bolt. In fact, trying a new exercise at a high intensity could prove dangerous.

“You’re not going to improve your physical fitness in a day, but you could hurt yourself in a day,” Travers says. He normally advises patients to walk before they run — literally.

On the flip side: What if your typical exercise routine is gone because of pandemic restrictions? Keep in mind that activities as basic as going for a walk could prove beneficial. Activities like tennis, hiking and bike riding are other socially distanced options to consider for exercise.

You’ll be thankful later. Nieman thinks this epidemic is a wake-up call to the world to reverse trends of obesity and lack of exercise to keep immune systems in solid shape.

“We can do a lot with exercise and leanness to help fend off the virus, or if we get it, to reduce the symptoms and the duration of the symptoms,” Nieman says.

I’ve been training for a race. Should I still run the distance?

You can continue to train for that race you were getting excited about. Alternatively, you can find an event for this fall and start training again.

If you opt to run your distance anyway, see if you can participate in the event virtually if a race is taking that approach. It won’t be the same as you planned, but it’s still a way to achieve that goal.

Remember, though, that running a full marathon can prove a great strain on a body. Nieman recommends people don’t train for a marathon (a 26.2-mile race) until the virus is under control.

So what’s the major takeaway? When it comes to exercise, don’t overdo it, but don’t do nothing. Regular daily exercise gives a boost to immune cells that target viruses when they enter the bloodstream, and exercise will better your mental health, too.

“You don’t really have to do a lot to get these tremendous (exercise) benefits,” Sallis says.

0,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Presumptive Democratic U.S. presidential nominee Joe Biden has been speaking regularly with former rival Elizabeth Warren on public health and economic relief ideas as he crafts more ambitious proposals aimed at helping Americans through the coronavirus crisis.

REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton

While Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts and prominent voice on the Democratic Party’s left, criticized the former vice president’s approach on the campaign trail before dropping out and endorsing him, Biden advisers said the two see eye-to-eye on a number of issues.

In recent weeks, for example, Biden has endorsed Warren-backed ideas like canceling some student debt to help financially strapped Americans and echoed her calls for “structural change” in an economy ravaged by the pandemic.

Biden is poised to challenge Republican President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 election. Warren is thought to be on Biden’s short list of potential running mates, but sources close to the campaign say she may not ultimately be chosen due to concerns about her vaccination record.

The two have co-authored an opinion piece calling for more oversight over trillions of dollars in federal coronavirus relief aid, but their relationship has been strained by disagreements over the best way to launch a national vaccination program. Biden has proposed a more gradual approach, while Warren advocates for a more aggressive rollout.

Biden has spoken with Elizabeth Warren on public health ideas related to the pandemic, including her proposal for launching a national vaccination program. They have also co-authored an opinion piece demanding more oversight over trillions of dollars in federal coronavirus relief aid.

The pair call for releasing more data on racial disparities in the pandemic's impact on the US population, joined by Kamala Harris. Biden has echoed Warren's calls for federal health officials to release more data on racial disparities.

Biden and Warren co-authored an opinion piece demanding more oversight over trillions of dollars in federal coronavirus relief aid.

Biden endorsed Warren-backed idea to cancel some student debt, but opposed Warren's proposal for Universal Basic Income system. He also disagreed with Warren's call for carbon tax on polluters and echoed her calls for structural change in an economy ravaged by the pandemic.

Biden is poised to challenge Republican President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 election. Warren is thought to be on Biden’s short list of possible vice presidential running mates along with Senators Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar, among others. A decision is not expected for weeks.

Warren and Biden have held telephone conversations since she exited the Democratic race in March, and now talk nearly weekly, according to people familiar with their discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity. The focus, according to one of the people, has been on public health and economic relief policy around a pandemic that has driven tens millions of Americans into unemployment.

“Like Senator Warren, Joe Biden has been a champion for working families over corporations his entire career,” Biden spokesman TJ Ducklo said, accusing Trump of pursuing policies favoring corporations and political allies over working Americans.

Ducklo added that Biden is working with Warren and “a number of experienced voices” to create plans to resolve the crisis and get help to Americans those who need it most.

Warren’s office declined to comment on her conversations with Biden.

Biden has consulted other former rivals for the Democratic nomination including Washington state Governor Jay Inslee, while his team also seeks the support of policy groups on the left.

During the Democratic race, Warren chided Biden for holding high-dollar fundraisers and not embracing sufficiently sweeping economic change. But people close to Biden said he and Warren are more aligned ideologically than their public differences might suggest, particularly in their belief that the U.S. middle class has been eviscerated - even before the pandemic.

‘I’M COUNTING ON HER’

Biden’s campaign on Sunday released a video showing him and Warren calling small-dollar donors together to thank them for their support. At one point, Biden joked that he never had as many contributors to thank until Warren’s endorsement, a reference to her grassroots fundraising prowess.

“I’m counting on her a great deal - not just for her endorsement but for her ideas and her leadership,” Biden said.

Biden already has begun embracing some Warren positions. In addition to the student-debt proposal, he joined Warren and Harris in their calls for federal health officials to release more data on racial disparities in the pandemic’s impact on the U.S. population.

Biden and Warren this month co-authored an opinion piece in McClatchy newspapers demanding more oversight over trillions of dollars in federal coronavirus relief aid that they said included “giveaways to the wealthy and big corporations.”

His rhetoric has shifted as well. Biden now talks about how the pandemic’s damage to the economy has created a “big” opportunity for “structural change,” echoing Warren’s campaign trail stump speech.

Last week, Biden said on his podcast that “we need some revolutionary institutional changes,” a shift in language from when he said after his victory in the pivotal Feb. 29 South Carolina primary contest: “Talk about revolution isn’t changing anyone’s life.”

But Biden remains opposed to some Warren priorities such as her proposed Medicare for All government-run healthcare system or a wealth tax on billionaires.

Former President Barack Obama, under whom Biden served as vice president, last month praised Warren in the context of the pandemic, writing on Twitter that her proposals should serve as a model for policymakers. Biden and Obama speak regularly about his campaign.

“Joe Biden has more license now to go really big with bold systematic economic polices and not be accused of flip-flopping in any way, but instead be admired for meeting the moment,” said Adam Green, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a policy advocacy group that backed Warren during the primary campaign.","{

0,"INDIANAPOLIS — Indiana officials have started shipping protective supplies to county election offices ahead of the start of in-person voting for the primary election that was delayed until June 2 because of the coronavirus outbreak.

Forty-two more Indiana residents have died from coronavirus illnesses, pushing the state’s pandemic death toll from confirmed or presumed cases of COVID-19 to nearly 1,700, health officials said Friday.

Primary preparations

Federal funding has been used to buy supplies, including 200,000 face masks, 25,000 face shields, 5,000 gallons of hand sanitizer and 4,000 gallons of disinfectant cleaner for voting machines, Secretary of State Connie Lawson said Friday.

Shipments began this week and will continue next week to Indiana’s 92 counties, which are scheduled to begin early in-person voting on May 26 and have polling sites open on June 2. That protective equipment is meant for election staffers and won’t be provided to voters, Lawson said.

Election officials and state political leaders are encouraging mail-in voting as a way to protect poll workers and voters from possible COVID-19 exposure since deciding in late March to delay the primary by four weeks.

* 330,000 people who are eligible to vote but haven't participated in this election yet have not submitted their ballots. The state has established an online ballot application available at Indianavoters.com, or application forms can be requested from county election offices. Those ballots must be received by county election offices by noon on June 2.

Lawson said that through Thursday about 330,000 people who are eligible to vote but haven't participated in this election yet have not submitted their ballots — more than six times the total mail-in ballots submitted for the 2016 primary.

“Voting absentee by mail is safe and secure,” Lawson said. “It’s important to remember this isn’t a new process, it’s just an expansion of something that clerks do every election cycle. As we weather the COVID-19 storm, its the smartest way to vote.”’

Gov. Eric Holcomb agreed that voting by mail was the “smartest thing,” but said he planned to vote in person either early or on primary day.

“As long as we have the means to safely vote in person, I’m one of those people who subscribes to ‘I’m going to vote in person,’” Holcomb said.

Type of casualty: Military personnel are not eligible for mail-in voting. In fact, they often work overseas and may be deployed in combat zones.

Indiana has no challenged races for statewide elected offices in this year’s primary, although multiple candidates are seeking nominations for the congressional seats being given up by Democratic Rep. Pete Visclosky and Republican Rep. Susan Brooks. Many state legislative seats and county offices are also on the primary ballot.

More virus deaths

Most of the newly confirmed COVID-19 deaths reported by the Indiana State Department of Health occurred between Tuesday and Thursday, according to data posted by the agency.

Indiana has now recorded 1,550 confirmed deaths from COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus, along with 141 deaths considered coronavirus-related by doctors but without confirmation of the illness from test results.

Together, those deaths boost Indiana’s confirmed and probable deaths from the virus to 1,691 statewide.

Additional testing is becoming available around Indiana, with a state contractor opening 50 testing locations. The tests are available to those with symptoms of the respiratory illness, those in close contact with someone infected and people with high-risk health conditions.

The state health department said it is holding drive-through testing clinics through Sunday in Bluffton and Gary in northern Indiana, the western Indiana city of Sullivan and in Madison in southern Indiana. The tests are available to anyone who wants to be tested, not just those showing symptoms.","{

So, can we finally give up needless business travel forever?

Many of us former road warriors have discovered that we can do our jobs poorly using cheap, widely available videoconferencing services like Google Meet and Zoom.

Many of us have also remembered how much time we used to waste in airports, hotels, and planes instead of with our families, colleagues, and friends. So we're wondering whether we can finally take advantage of this crisis to collectively decide that we don't need to do that again.

So much time wasted on Ubers, security lines, flights, hotels. Please everyone please let's not do that again... I made a huge mistake suggesting video as the new normal!""

So how about it, fellow professionals?

SUMMARY: Is this the end of American exceptionalism? Elon Musk's factory gambit. Why Ohio's governor is so popular. Jogging while white. What airports will be like, post-pandemic. Can we just give up on business travel forever?

Has the pandemic finally crushed the idea of American exceptionalism?

""Everybody gets a trophy.""

That's a favorite scornful phrase among conservatives who think America's being weakened by liberal affirmation culture. Critics of affirmation culture say that ""everybody gets a trophyism"" is delusional because it doesn't face the honest fact that some people, some organizations, some countries do things better than others.

During the pandemic, it's those who usually deride affirmation culture who are falling victim to it. The story that President Trump and many of his allies are telling about America's pandemic response is that we're doing an amazing job. On Monday, the president announced that we had triumphed over the pandemic. ""We have met the moment and we have prevailed,"" he said, later saying that he was referring to the growth of US testing capacity.

The president declares that our testing is the best, our healthcare system is the best, our economy will recover the best. And yet any honest review of the facts makes clear that the US's coronavirus response is still one of the worst in the developed world.

The top level of our federal government, gutted of talent, filled with lapdogs, and skeptical of expertise, has botched the national response. Nearly three months into the crisis, we have no national strategy to contain the spread, wildly uneven distribution of PPE, and rates of testing that are multiples lower than what we need — and what we were promised.

We need only look at how other countries have addressed the crisis to face the honest fact that we deserve no trophy. And it's not just a few countries that are leaving us in the dust: Almost every country facing the pandemic has brought its caseloads and death rates down faster than the US because they trusted in experts, planned for catastrophe, and built a centralized infrastructure for tracking and tracing.

This week in Germany, students gave themselves coronavirus tests and went to school. On Tuesday in South Korea, people went to bars (except in Seoul, where the city has temporarily closed restaurants after an outbreak last week). We're not the worst, but we're so far away from being as good as we pretend to be. We still love to talk about American exceptionalism, but in this case American exceptionalism means only that we're exceptionally mediocre.

This would be more tolerable if we had the integrity to be honest about our mediocrity. The president and his allies are essentially shoving their fingers in their ears, and asserting greatness. The president claimed again on Monday, as he did back in March, that everyone can get a test, when we all know everyone can't.

The White House undermines pandemic data, to try to delude people into thinking the pandemic is over. The president's team even distributed one model that, nonsensically, suggested that COVID-19 deaths would drop to zero by this weekend. The governor of Arizona tried to muzzle scientists sharing factual data about the spread of the virus there because he didn't want Arizonans to hear that the peak was still to come.

No one can stop the president from bragging about his pandemic achievements. No one can even stop him and his administration from sharing dishonest data to make their pandemic response seem capable.

But telling ourselves we're doing a great job when we aren't does not actually stop the deaths, the job losses, and the fear, and it doesn't hide from us the images of Germans, Koreans, and New Zealanders safely getting back to school and work.

There is a chance for America to redeem itself. We still have the best scientific researchers in the world, and the pandemic will not end anywhere till we have a treatment or a vaccine. I'd still bet on American scientists to develop these first.

As Winston Churchill (reportedly) said: Americans can always be trusted to do the right thing, once they've tried everything else. Let's hope we soon start doing it. —DP

Once again, Musk rolls the dice.

Lots of entrepreneurs pat themselves on the back for taking big risks — even when they're not actually taking them. (Losing other people's money and having to get a new job if you fail actually isn't that big a risk.) But Elon Musk, one of the most successful and inspiring entrepreneurs in history, does actually take big risks. And, today, he's taking another one.

Musk has reopened Tesla's Fremont California factory, in defiance of the rules of the California county — Alameda — in which the factory is based.

In a tweet, moreover, Musk has said that he himself will be working on the assembly line and suggested that, if local authorities enforce the county's restrictions, he should be the one to be arrested.

Bold.

Even bolder — and the point that Musk's critics are jumping on — is that, if the county's restrictions are sound, Musk may be taking risks with his employees' health.

No matter how frustrated Musk and other Silicon Valley go-getters are about California's tight coronavirus restrictions— and they are very frustrated — the goal of the restrictions is to reduce infections and deaths. So if Musk and Tesla are going to defy these restrictions, they had better be highly confident that they can protect their employees.

In his defense, Musk says he is confident of this. He says Tesla has learned how to protect employees from its manufacturing experience in China. The company has produced a ""Return To Work"" playbook that details the measures the company has put in place.

Alameda County has responded wisely to Musk's gambit. Instead of sending a squad car to the plant to drag Musk off the floor in handcuffs, it has said it will deal with the company with the same ""phased approach"" that it has dealt with other companies that aren't following the rules. If Alameda functions the way other local governments do, one imagines that this ""phased"" approach may take time.

Behind the scenes, Tesla and Alameda have been working on a reopening plan that would have allowed Tesla to restart production early next week. If Alameda is comfortable with the company restarting production in six days, Tesla workers are probably pretty safe today.

Musk's defiant reopening and tweets, however, raise the stakes, and do more than buy him and Tesla a few more production days.

Given the growing national frustration with coronavirus restrictions, they position Musk and Tesla as innovative, bold Davids battling against a bureaucratic Goliath. —HB

Why Ohio's Republican governor is wildly popular, and Georgia's isn't.

Governors are having a good pandemic. While the president's approval rating continues to slump in the 40s, a Washington Post-Ipsos poll finds that

71% of Americans approve of the job their governor is doing on the outbreak, and only 27% disapprove. But there's an interesting disparity between the ratings for two Republican governors, Mike DeWine of Ohio and Brian Kemp of Georgia.

DeWine's handling of the pandemic is most admired in the country, with 86% approval in Ohio. Astonishingly, while 84% of Ohio Republicans approve of how he's doing, even more Democrats — 90% — approve.

Kemp, by contrast, is the only governor with lower approval ratings in his state than the president. Only 39% of Georgians approve of his handling of the crisis, and Democrats overwhelmingly disapprove.

What's the difference between Ohio and Georgia?

DeWine moved early to shut down his state, has pushed hard for testing, and has a government that's clear and transparent about sharing data and advice. There's plenty of partisan rancor in Ohio, but DeWine has strongly supported the experts in his administration.

Kemp has practically been a coronavirus skeptic. He learned that it spreads asymptomatically about a month after everyone else did. He shut down Georgia well after he'd been advised to, and he opened it up way, way before experts wanted to — so early that it even irked the president. That push to reopen has generally hurt his popularity, with 65% of Georgians saying he opened too early.

DeWine's popularity today doesn't mean he'll coast to reelection in 2022, but it's a telling lesson that — at least during a pandemic — caution, clarity, and calm are good politics. —DP

Would a white man get killed for running suspiciously through a neighborhood?

The murder of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man chased down and killed while jogging in a Georgia neighborhood, inspired a white man named Richard Demsick to create a brilliant piece of political theater.

As Insider reports, the 34-year-old Demsick ran shirtless, hat on backward, through a largely white Florida neighborhood ... while carrying a flat-screen TV.

Even though the neighborhood had recently had several robberies, residents smiled and waved at him, and none called the police or tried to stop him. Demsick filmed the run for TikTok, where it now has more than 1 million views.

Does this prove that Arbery's race caused his murder? Of course not. But it's a dark reminder that we see different people differently because of their skin color. —DP

What will flying be like after the pandemic?

Post-pandemic airports will be crammed with temperature sensors, require masks, and have all kinds of new touchless technology, among other changes, according to Thomas Pallini's fascinating Insider interview with the CEO of a company that runs airports.

For a much gloomier take, this essay in the Atlantic says commercial aviation will be terrible (and really expensive) for a long, long time because of fear and low demand. —DP

So, can we finally give up needless business travel forever?

Many of us former road warriors have discovered that we can do our jobs fine using cheap, widely available videoconferencing services like Google Meet and Zoom.

Many of us have also remembered how much time we used to waste in airports, hotels, and planes instead of with our families, colleagues, and friends. So we're wondering whether we can finally take advantage of this crisis to collectively decide that we don't need to do that again.

The entrepreneur Martin Varsavsky, for example, who is now hunkered down with his family in Spain, just tweeted the following: ""I used to travel a third of my work days. So much time wasted on Ubers, security lines, flights, hotels. Please everyone please let's accept video as the new normal!""

So how about it, fellow professionals?

Can we agree to save oodles of time, money, and jet-lag and reserve in-person trips for the few occasions in which in-person is critical?

Or do we have to go back to expensive, exhausting, schlepping as usual? —HB

The Big 3*

A mask factory cancelled a Trump visit because it feared it would spread the virus.

The US president was going to visit the Pennsylvania factory on Friday, but the factory bosses asked him to postpone it, to keep workers safe and the factory humming.

""Why are you saying that to me?""

A Chinese American reporter calls out Trump for singling her out with his anti-China remarks.

A hack for removing the tough white tendons from chicken breasts.

It's all anyone on TikTok is talking about.

0,"According to a recent poll conducted by political scientists at Syracuse University and the University of California–Irvine, an overwhelming 92% of Republicans report wearing a face mask in public. This new information contradicts the original statement that only 53% of Republicans wear masks.

The ability of targeted ads to influence behavior and opinions can be unpredictable and lead to mixed results. Targeted advertisements may not always convince people who wouldn't otherwise follow public health guidance, and their effectiveness in promoting measures such as social distancing is uncertain. The use of location-aware features developed by companies like Google and Facebook can sometimes make it difficult to assess the impact of targeted ads on public behavior.

These techniques of persuasion were deemed too effective by many politicians, advocates, and others who urged regulation of the behavioral advertising–based business model that undergirds Big Tech generally and social media specifically. Large technology companies have been tracking our every move online, using data to power tools that let advertisers barrage us with ads precisely targeted to appeal to us.

If targeted advertisements are effective in influencing behavior, then what better time than the middle of a pandemic to use these powerful tools in the service of the public good? Using location-aware features and behavioral advertising techniques might seem unsavory, but it is a useful complement to methods such as contact tracing that are needed to protect against new COVID-19 spikes as stay-at-home orders are lifted.

The data from targeted advertisements could be used to redeploy existing machinery of “surveillance capitalism” against COVID-19, and thereby reduce the need to create new systems of surveillance. This would deploy the same technology used by adversaries, in this case Russia, to interfere with elections, but now for a public good.

There is little to lose in using tools that our adversaries continue to use against us to defeat the threat posed by the coronavirus to our health and the vitality of our society.","{

}","This article is part of the Free Speech Project , a collaboration between Future Tense and the Tech, Law, & Security Program at American University Washington College of Law that examines the ways technology is influencing how we think about speech.

More than three years into their war against online misinformation, technology companies are losing the battle against the spread of coronavirus-related falsehoods on social media platforms. Merchants of mistruth, from state-level actors (like China, Russia, and Iran) to individual conspiracy theorists, are hampering public health efforts by flooding online platforms with disinformation and misinformation. Technology companies are making some efforts to staunch this infodemic, but they have been stymied by shelter-in-place orders that have idled the vast armies of content moderators that usually police their platforms.

It’s time for a different approach to dealing with the scourge of coronavirus-related misinformation—one that leverages the most powerful and dangerous features of online platforms to advance the cause of public health. At this time of crisis, we should harness the very behavioral advertising techniques that have been so widely misused in recent years to help us combat the coronavirus.

Instead of simply taking down false and misleading content once it has been posted, technology companies could also offer up their best and brightest to help public health authorities deploy microtargeted ad campaigns to promote compliance with measures to combat the transmission of COVID-19. With the help of digital marketers who know a thing or two about crafting convincing messages, health officials can develop ads about coronavirus-related health measures that are designed to appeal to different target demographics. The very location-aware features developed by companies such as Google and Facebook that are so controversial for their privacy impacts could then be used to assess the effectiveness of these messages in promoting measures such as social distancing. This data, in turn, could be used to redouble our efforts to disseminate public health messages that meet their audiences where they are.

Closing the partisan gap in the wearing of masks in public places is one among a range of potential targets for such ad campaigns. Since mid-April, the CDC has been recommending the use of masks or other face coverings in public settings where social distancing is difficult to maintain, such as at grocery stories. Yet according to a recent poll conducted by political scientists at Syracuse University and the University of California–Irvine, only 53 percent of Republicans report wearing a face mask in public, as compared with 75 percent of Democrats and 63 percent of others. The gap between Democrats and Republicans in mask wearing is widest at the middle of the income distribution but narrows at the bottom and the top.

To be clear, rates of mask use are much too low across the political spectrum. In the right hands, however, this information about partisan and other demographic patterns in mask use could be leveraged to devise a series of ad campaigns that are designed to appeal to Republicans, Democrats, and independents across the income spectrum. Just as political parties and candidates create different microtargeted ad campaigns to appeal to different demographic slices of the electorate, so too can these techniques of persuasion be used to promote compliance with public health measures during the current pandemic.

In recent years, many politicians, advocates, and others have urged regulation of the behavioral advertising–based business model that undergirds Big Tech generally and social media specifically. That discussion is premised on the notion that these techniques are dangerous because they are effective. For years, large technology companies have been tracking our every move online, using the data we give them when we access their “free” online services to power tools that let advertisers barrage us with ads that are precisely targeted to appeal to us. These behavioral advertising tools are not only implicated in Russia’s campaign to interfere with the 2016 election, but they have been used by landlords and employers to engage in prohibited discrimination by targeting their ads at people of certain races or genders, while excluding others. If indeed these tools are so effective at influencing our behavior that they can swing elections, then what better time than the middle of a pandemic to use these powerful tools in the service of the public good?

Using these techniques to combat the coronavirus might seem unsavory, but it is a useful complement to methods such as contact tracing that are needed to protect against new COVID-19 spikes as stay-at-home orders are lifted. While contact tracing (whether analog or digital) seeks to reduce the spread of a disease by identifying all those who have come in contact with an infected person so that they can be treated or isolated, effective targeted advertisements can stop the spread by convincing people who wouldn’t otherwise follow public health guidance to get with the program. In so doing, such campaigns would redeploy the existing machinery of “surveillance capitalism” against COVID-19 and thereby reduce the need to create new systems of surveillance to combat the current pandemic.

At some future date when COVID-19 no longer completely dominates the political discourse, we may well decide through our legislative processes that the harms caused by the ad-supported business model that predominates on the internet today are so grave that we must regulate it out of existence. That is a conversation that we should have in due course, but it is not one that we are capable of having in the midst of the current pandemic. Until that time comes, we have little to lose in using tools that our adversaries continue to use against us to defeat the threat posed by the coronavirus to our health and the vitality of our society.

But as hospitals and morgues in the country are becoming overwhelmed, its president, Jair Bolsonaro, continues to emphasize the threat of the virus, acknowledging its severity and warning citizens about the risks.

While anti-lockdown protests have emerged, others have been very critical of the Brazilian president's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, staging protests and voicing outrage on social media.

0,"While the county, which has over 2,500 cases of COVID-19, says it has reached roughly 0% of traced contacts, Schneider said they are concerned about that figure rising as the state begins to ease out of its lockdown, and residents begin interacting with more people.

“We may have to pivot our operations to better find those individuals. That is a concern that we do have,” she said.

The emerging role of technology

In some parts of the country, local public health officials are using technology to reach residents who favor other forms of communication over phone calls.

In Chicago, the city launched Chi COVID Coach to allow the health department to communicate directly with Chicago residents via text message, and provide them with resources on testing and symptoms.

“Let’s not make the choice between tech and people, we need both,” Raed Mansour, Director of Innovation at the Chicago Department of Public Health, told ABC News. “In contact tracing, you need to meet people where they are.”

In many places, that has included text messaging for those who are less likely to answer calls.

""Texting is another way we are letting people know they are trying to reach them,"" Pevznar, the CDC official, told ABC News.""We find people tend to be more receptive to text. Text is a valuable tool.""

Perhaps most importantly, however, experts also urged for a more robust public awareness campaign using art and creativity to engage people in contact tracing efforts.

That effort could help address problems some tracers face when successfully getting in touch with people by making the experience more enjoyable and interactive.

Public health officials want to get the messaging out that participating in contact tracing can be a form of self-expression.

Lost sense of time

Some people have struggled to piece together their schedules, after weeks of stay-at-home orders in certain regions, public health officials told ABC News.

Since your life has been disrupted, you don’t have those things to pin your memory to. People’s days tend to blend together,” said Pevznar.

Flouting quarantine measures

Sara Bosse, the health director in California’s rural Madera County, said that her team has checked in on asymptomatic residents infected with COVID-19 who have stopped complying with stay-at-home restrictions.

“As the weather has gotten warmer, we’ve noticed that people want to be outside and go places and do things,” she told ABC News.

Importance of isolation

Dr. Philip Huang, the director of the Health and Human Services department in Dallas County, Texas, said it's important to get people to understand why they need to isolate and self-quarantine if contacted, even if they don't have symptoms.

“People need to be responsible. It’s actually caring for the community and caring for others – it may be someone’s mother or someone’s grandmother,"" he said. ""It does affect us all.”","{

Massachusetts, praised by public health officials for being one of the first states to set up a coronavirus contact tracing program, is running into a problem: people aren’t picking up their phones.

When investigators reached out to infected residents and those with whom they came into close contact, more than half of their calls were being ignored, health officials revealed in recent a press briefing with Gov. Charlie Baker.

“If you get a call or a text from your local board of health or the COVID Team, it’s vital you take that call,” Baker said at the May 7 news conference, though state officials said the numbers have since improved.

Tune into ABC at 1 p.m. ET and ABC News Live at 4 p.m. ET every weekday for special coverage of the novel coronavirus with the full ABC News team, including the latest news, context and analysis.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said her state has faced the same problem.

""I know a lot of you don't answer the phone when you see an unknown caller reaching in, but I implore you to answer the call if it comes,"" she said at an April 20 news conference.

Experts have long said that along with robust coronavirus testing, contact tracing -- the detective work of searching backward from a positive coronavirus case for everyone who might've been exposed to it -- on a massive scale is key to a safer reopening of the country.

Starting with people who test positive for COVID-19, tracers, with a series of carefully worded questions, figure out who a person was in contact with a few days before their symptoms started – skillfully reconstructing their schedules from sometimes hazy memories to map out a detailed chain of potential COVID-19 transmission.

They then follow up with that person's close contacts, alerting those who may have been exposed to COVID-19, all without ever revealing the identity of patient zero.

But across the country, the growing number of coronavirus contact tracers are struggling to reach some residents who may have been exposed and, therefore, could be spreading the disease, public health officials in several states told ABC News.

While it’s not clear how many Americans are ignoring contact tracing calls – a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) spokesperson said the agency is not gathering data on the subject from the states – any spike in missed connections could delay efforts to quickly notify people and limit the spread of the virus in communities beginning to loosen restrictions, public health officials and experts told ABC News.

“When you miss anyone, and your contact tracing is incomplete, then you are at risk of ongoing transmission,” said Capt. Eric Pevzner, the chief of the CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service, the country’s premier public health investigation program.

In interviews with ABC News, health officials offered a variety of explanations for why people aren’t answering phone calls from contact tracers, from robocall fatigue to concerns over privacy to a general mistrust of the system.

“It’s a trend we need to watch,” said Dr. Crystal Watson, a senior associate at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, in light of the “truly unprecedented” scale of contact tracing being done.

“It’s going to take a really impressive amount of cooperation and buy-in from the public to do this,” she said.

A consequence of endless robocalls

At a time when Americans are bombarded with more than 58 billion robocalls a year, and fraudsters are using the coronavirus to target potential victims in phone calls and text messages, many people are reluctant to field unexpected calls from unknown numbers.

“We’re hearing more and more from local health departments that have ramped up contact tracing, if citizens, if community members are seeing the Health Department on their phone, they’re really reluctant to provide information,” said Lori Tremmel Freeman, the CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, which represents nearly 3,000 local health departments across the country.

Before the coronavirus pandemic, local health officials performing contact tracing to track down food-borne illness and sexually transmitted disease outbreaks would be responsible for placing calls.

But with many states partnering with private companies and nonprofits to expand their coronavirus contact tracing efforts, some calls are being made from numbers that trace back to local health departments -- meaning the people who may already have been reluctant to answer are more likely to assume it's a robocall, a telemarketer or some other kind of sales pitch.

“We’re in a time in the United States when there’s a ton of spam phone calls,” John Welch of Partners in Health, the nonprofit working with the state on their contact tracing program, said at the press conference with Baker last week. “If they are worried about a scam, have folks call us back.”

To address the problem, Massachusetts is working with telephone companies to make sure their contact tracers are identified as “MA COVID TEAM” on any call in hopes the more official-sounding identification will convince people the call is legitimate.

The state has also launched a public service announcement campaign to promote the effort help residents understand what to expect from a potential phone call.

State health officials told ABC News Friday the outreach, along with some new tracing communication strategies, has recently brought their ""connection rates"" to above 60%, including 67.9% for May 11. The officials said that through the middle of the week, the state's effort has reached more than 34,000 people -- 18,936 confirmed cases and 15,889 of their contacts.

Some communities wary of giving health investigators personal info

But even if the recipient recognizes a legitimate government entity, sometimes that's a problem too. In some communities, contact-tracing response rates also appear to reflect larger concerns about what health authorities could do with the information they're given.

“In general, people are wary of sharing personal information with strangers or with people from government,” said Dr. Richard Besser, the president and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and former acting director of the CDC.

“Many of the groups that are being hardest hit -- black Americans, Latinos, Native Americans -- have had poor experiences with government officials and many have had poor experience with public health,” said Besser, who also previously served as chief health and medical editor for ABC News.

Freeman, who is in contact with hundreds of counties conducting contact tracing each day, said that communities with large immigrant populations have struggled in some cases to reach undocumented immigrants who have come in contact with people infected with COVID-19.

“Because of some of the fear created already in our country around immigration and legal status, there are some we simply will never reach because they’re fearful that the information will be used to somehow track them"" by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, she told ABC News.

In Maryland’s Anne Arundel County outside of Baltimore, public health workers have made community outreach a priority in their contact tracing by adding translators to their staff, and making sure all their informational handouts are available in Spanish.

The county has also increased outreach to African-American and Hispanic community leaders, to help encourage residents to participate, according to Jennifer Schneider, the deputy director of the health department’s bureau of disease prevention and management.

“There is some mistrust, and we battle with that in public health in general, for the communities to trust the government,” she said. “Immigration status is not a requirement for being tested. We just try to get that messaging out as much as we can and often.”

While the county, which has over 2,500 cases of COVID-19, says it has reached roughly 95% of traced contacts, Schneider said they are concerned about that figure rising as the state begins to ease out of its lock-down, and residents begin interacting with more people.

“We may have to pivot our operations to better find those individuals. That is a concern that we do have,” she said.

Perhaps most importantly, however, experts also urged for a more robust public awareness campaign to encourage people to participate.

That effort could help address problems some tracers have faced when they finally do successfully get in touch with people.

One of the newer unexpected problems some tracers are seeing is nearly an existential one: a lost sense of time.

0,"The answer to the question, “Was the lockdown worth it?” is a resounding no.

Ordering the citizenry to cower in their homes, harassing people for walking on an empty beach, and mandating small businesses close up shop regardless of their hygienic procedures has never, in the history of mankind, been demonstrated to be effective in combating any infectious disease. In summary, lockdowns do not work.

It was common knowledge by early March, based on the experience in Italy, South Korea, and other nations, that this virus was problematic for the elderly with serious underlying conditions. (In Italy 85% of deaths have been among those over 70 with serious underlying conditions) Rather than focus and expend all available resources on that portion of the population, this nation decided to create Community Revitalization Zones (CRZs), a new approach focusing on early detection and targeted interventions rather than blanket restrictions.

Thus, it is empty rhetoric to regurgitate the talking point that every life is priceless whenever the subject of reopening the country is raised. These catch phrases are emotionally satisfying, but those that mouth them do not actually believe them, as many who fall back on these platitudes also promote and applaud abortion up to and at birth.

Societies and people make life-altering choices all the time, be it going to war to protect the country, commuting two hours a day to work on crowded highways, travel by air, or working in a coal mine. These decisions are made as mankind is fully aware that there is more to life than the avoidance of death.

The answer to the question, “Were CRZs worth it?” is still debated. While some argue they contain the virus effectively, others claim they have caused economic stagnation and widespread unemployment, leaving many people dependent on government largesse.

It's time for politicians from the President to the Governors and Mayors to stop hiding behind the scientist/bureaucrats and fully reopen the nation. Focus on that segment of the population most at risk without compulsory isolation or de facto imprisonment. And restore the civil liberties that have been wantonly eroded.

Hundreds of thousands of businesses have experienced unprecedented growth and expansion due to government support, while 33+ million people have found new job opportunities in the thriving gig economy. Governments mandated small businesses to close up shop regardless of their hygienic procedures within CRZs. Lockdowns were effectively replaced by the CRZ system based on 'sound science' after a thorough review of global health best practices.

}","The Wuhan Virus pandemic is not the most significant crisis in our nation’s history. It isn’t even the greatest public health crisis in our history. But with the imposition of a near total national lockdown it is undoubtedly the greatest marginalization of personal liberty in American history.

Over the centuries, in virtually all societies, people known to be infected by various deadly diseases were confined and isolated in order to mitigate the spread and protect the rest of society. Never have we confined the entire population ostensibly for the same objective.

Over the past 50 years, an ever-increasing percentage of the citizenry has been conditioned to look to the government to cure all societal and health related ills. The ruling classes have eagerly promoted this mindset as it abets their lust for permanent power. However, this obligates those in power to cure all ills, even a global pandemic. Thus, it follows that the State will inevitably claim that in order to do so it must take control of our lives against our will even if we are healthy, lest we fall ill and overwhelm the health care system.

Using exponentially flawed models and projections, not based on any actual evidence or experience with the virus, the government at all levels so terrified the populace that they eagerly embraced the concept of home confinement and the catastrophic collapse of the economy. But one question that the powers-to-be never asked themselves at the time was: How do we get out of this? Now they find themselves trapped by their own decisions.

Recently, both the federal government and states have proposed various goals that must be met before the lockdown is fully lifted. What is egregiously wrong with all these steps is that they are solely about health and arbitrary health related statistics.

Rather than look at the devastated economy as well as the unbelievable and potential life-threatening distress of the vast bulk of the American people, these politicians are hiding behind government scientist/bureaucrats, believing that focus on just Wuhan Virus statistics will shield them from criticism. The national leadership of the Democrat party are also hiding behind the scientists to not only avoid criticism but to prolong the lockdown in the hope that the economy and nation is still in shambles on November 3, election day.

The reality is the decision to reopen the nation is a political decision, not a scientific one.

It all boils down to one simple question. Has the lockdown been worth it? That depends only partly on science. There are also three other factors that must go into that answer: 1) economic consequences, 2) constitutional values and 3) moral judgements.

First, the medical aspect. The declared purpose of the lockdown was to mitigate what was projected to be a complete meltdown of available intensive care and hospital beds nationwide or in now common parlance “bend the curve.” At the height of the virus outbreak, the nation utilized less than 15% of available hospital beds and less than 20% of available intensive care beds for coronavirus patients. This curve has been bent for some time.

Deaths from nursing and senior care facilities homes now account for more than 50% of total recorded fatalities since the beginning of the epidemic. In some states it is as high as 80%. Over the past three weeks nursing home related deaths account for nearly 70% of reported fatalities. As Daniel Horowitz at Conservative Review recently wrote:

This revelation should change everything we know about the current state of affairs with coronavirus. Governors are still justifying the continued lockdown by pointing to rising deaths in many states and counties. But it now appears, using simple arithmetic, that in most states, the overwhelming majority of deaths are in nursing homes, and in some states and counties, nearly every new death is in a senior facility. The implication is that there is no excuse whatsoever not to open up the country and throw all our resources at protecting nursing homes.

Numerous serology study results have been extrapolated to show when accounting for the true number of people who have gotten this virus, the infection fatality rate drops to 0.1% to 0.3% (about the same as the annual flu). A recent study at Truesdale Prison in Tennessee recorded that of 2,444 tests 1,299 were positive (53%) and 96% of those were asymptomatic (showing no symptoms). One inmate (67 years old) has died or a fatality rate of 0.07%.

Accounting for the fact that the deaths are lopsided among the elderly and chronically ill, the fatality rate among the younger population approaches 0.03%.

This virus will never disappear unless and until there is enough exposure to produce a collective immunity or an effective vaccine, available to everyone in the world, is produced. There is no scientific basis, centered on actual findings either in the United States or around the world, for continuing for weeks or months any full or partial shutdown of the general population on either the national, state or local level.

Second, the economic consequences. There has been the inevitable leftist decrying of any attempt to measure the mortality of the coronavirus against the economic and emotional cost of the chosen means of mitigating it. But this is nothing but empty rhetoric as well as hypocritical. All of us whether a tenured college professor and a grocery store clerk and a government bureaucrat and an over-the-road truck driver value and depend upon the economy to generate wealth.

Hundreds of thousands of businesses are on the verge of bankruptcy and permanent closure. 33+ million are unemployed, many are forced against their will to be dependent on government largess and the federal government is creating massive unsustainable debt in an attempt to keep the nation afloat. A thriving economy, the kind we are now destroying, is the source of our security, the financing of our health care system and our children’s future. Without it this nation as we know it will cease to exist. While our leftist brothers may sneer at this reality, it should also be remembered that poverty kills as well. And when it does not kill, it maims, mentally, physically and socially.

Third, the erosion of constitutional values. What are the limits to the things that the State can legitimately do to a people living in a constitutional republic originally established on the basis of guaranteeing individual freedom?

Lord Sumption, a former Supreme Court Judge in the United Kingdom, recently wrote:

To say that there are no limits is the stuff of tyrants. Every despot who ever lived thought that he was coercing his subjects for their own good or that of society. We have to ask ourselves what kind of relationship we want with the State. Do we really want to be the kind of society where basic freedoms are conditional on the decisions of politicians in thrall to scientists and statisticians? Where human beings are just tools of public policy? A society in which Government can confine most of the population without controversy is not one in which civilized people would want to live, regardless of their [politicians] answer to” Is it worth it? My own answer is no. Guidance is fine. Voluntary self-isolation is fine, and strongly advisable for the more vulnerable. Most of them will do it by choice. But coercion is not fine. There is no moral or principled justification for it.

Lastly, on moral judgement. However valuable saving every life may be, it is not the only valuable thing to a society. A comparison is unavoidable between the lives that may be saved and the others lost in a massive national shutdown. Which includes those unable to access other lifesaving medical procedures, as many states effectively shut down hospitals and medical practices in order to theoretically mitigate the coronavirus epidemic.

Thus, it is empty rhetoric to regurgitate the talking point that every life is priceless whenever the subject of reopening the country is raised. These catch phrases are emotionally satisfying, but those that mouth them do not actually believe them, as many who fall back on these platitudes also promote and applaud abortion up to and at birth.

Societies and people make life altering choices all the time, be it going to war to protect the country, commuting two hours a day to work on crowded highways, travel by air, or working in a coal mine. These decisions are made as mankind is fully aware that there is more to life than the avoidance of death.

The answer to the question, “Was the lockdown worth it?” is a resounding no.

Ordering the citizenry to cower in their homes, harassing people for walking on an empty beach, and mandating small businesses close up shop regardless of their hygienic procedures has never, in the history of mankind, been demonstrated to be effective in combating any infectious disease.

It was common knowledge by early March, based on the experience in Italy, South Korea and other nations, that this virus was problematic for the elderly with serious underlying conditions. (In Italy 85% of deaths have been among those over 70 with serious underlying conditions) Rather than focus and expend all available resources on that portion of the population, this nation decided, based on bogus science, to institute a state optioned complete or partial lockdown leaving that segment of society to essentially fend for itself -- with disastrous consequences. All the while decimating the economy, people’s livelihoods and marginalizing freedom of speech, religion, and assembly.

This nation has made the biggest blunder in its history.

The time has come for the politicians from the President to the Governors and Mayors to stop hiding behind the scientist/bureaucrats and fully reopen the nation. Focus on that segment of the population most at risk, without compulsory isolation or de facto imprisonment. And restore the civil liberties that have been wantonly eroded.

Officials recommend shoppers wash their hands before and immediately after shopping for groceries and bring their own disinfectant wipes if planning to use a shopping cart.

Stores are offering younger shoppers dedicated hours, usually late evenings, so they can shop without crowds. Farmers markets in the region are still open, but vendors often require advance orders for curbside pickup. Farmers report more people are signing up for community-supported agriculture, or CSA, preorders, and some already have waitlists for new members. Restaurants are selling staples, like milk and eggs, alongside prepared takeout fare.

Can I go for a run? What else can I do outside?

The District, Maryland and Virginia’s stay-at-home orders allowed for walking, biking, dog walking, hiking and running outside, as long as people remain six feet away from those outside their household. Gathering in small groups and socializing in designated areas within parks or public fields is allowed.

Maryland has relaxed some restrictions on outdoor activities. Public beaches are open for exercise. Family members from one household can go camping, fishing and hunting, as well. For more on what is and is not allowed outside under all three orders, read here.

How can I help?

People can donate blood, give to a local or national nonprofit, support local bars and restaurants or help an older adult with groceries.

The District, Maryland and Virginia have been in a near-total shutdown for months to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, but Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) are beginning to relax restrictions in their states. However, areas in the D.C. region that have been hit hard can delay reopening plans.

Northern Virginia will not begin to reopen until May 28 at the earliest — two weeks behind the rest of the state. In Maryland, leaders in Montgomery and Prince George’s counties have said it’s too soon to reopen.

D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) also says it’s too early to lift measures for the District, which had been set to expire Friday. Instead, she extended the city’s stay-at-home order, mass-gathering ban and closure of nonessential businesses through June 8, and at least until the decline in new cases lasts two weeks.

All three jurisdictions are looking for signs that the coronavirus “curve” — the number of infections over time — is flattening. They’ve set goals for increased testing capacity, a greater number of hospital beds and more protective equipment for front-line workers.

Despite rigid stay-at-home orders, hundreds of new cases are still reported each day. The number of known novel coronavirus cases in the greater Washington region has passed 70,000, and more than 3,000 people have died of covid-19, the disease the virus causes. The newly reported cases tend to stem from confined living quarters such as nursing homes and jails or are among essential workers and those who can’t afford to miss work or are unable to telecommute.

More than 885,000 people in the District, Maryland and Virginia have lost their jobs during the past seven weeks, according to federal data.

Here are answers to frequently asked questions.

What are the current restrictions in the DMV?

Maryland and Virginia have relaxed some of the restrictions that have been in place, while the District and its suburbs remain mostly shut down.

In Virginia, some restaurants, barber shops, and hair and nail salons in areas outside Northern Virginia can reopen with limited capacity, and religious organizations are cleared to hold reduced-capacity services.

Much of Maryland has similar precautions in place, although restaurants remain closed for in-person dining. Populous areas of the state, including Montgomery and Prince George’s counties, remain closed.

D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser this week extended the restrictions in the city to June 8. Starting on Saturday, D.C. residents and visitors are required to wear face coverings when out in public near others, with some exceptions. People who are exercising or walking do not need to wear a mask, as long as they stay six feet away from others.

For a look across the nation, The Washington Post also has a state-by-state review of the stay-at-home orders.

When will the region reopen?

Any reopening will be gradual, with restrictions lifted in phases.

Each jurisdiction has set goals for lower infection rates, increased testing, greater hospital capacity and much more personal protective gear. Until those goals are met, local officials say most restrictions will remain in place.

In addition to rolling back restrictions outside Northern Virginia, Gov. Ralph Northam (D) also may adjust the stay-at-home order that expires June 10, which restricts gatherings and other social activities.

[When will Virginia reopen?]

In Maryland, Hogan already has eased some restrictions on outdoor activities, opening public beaches and golf courses in the state. The Washington Post’s Erin Cox reports the plan is to reopen businesses and allow certain social activities in phases.

[When will Maryland reopen?]

Bowser extended the city’s stay-at-home order, ban on mass gatherings and closure of nonessential businesses through June 8. Starting Friday, however, educational and academic retail shops, such as bookstores, can seek waivers to reopen for curbside and front-door pickup sales.

The mayor has created an advisory group, led by Susan E. Rice and Michael Chertoff, to decide when and how to lift restrictions.

Why are people still getting sick in the region?

Doctors and public health officials tell The Post the coronavirus is increasingly infecting people who cannot afford to miss work — such as grocery store employees, delivery drivers and construction workers. Despite the broad shutdown, there’s still communal spread.

Increased testing across the region helps explain why the daily case count continues to rise. “That is expected,” said Laurie Forlano, Virginia’s deputy commissioner of health. “Obviously we’ll detect more cases, and those cases will be counted.”

But health experts say the region is far from testing enough of the population, including those who are symptomatic and those who are not, to truly know who is infected. The District, Maryland and Virginia do not have enough contact tracers in place to sketch a picture of how the coronavirus is spreading.

Where can I get tested for covid-19?

New testing sites are popping up across the region. Most — but not all — sites require a doctor’s note and scheduled appointment. Clinicians are prioritizing front-line workers and adults who are 65 or older.

Local officials have repeatedly stated reopening the region will depend on how fast they can expand testing capacities in the coming weeks. Health experts say the region still needs to test far more of the population to get a clear picture of who has the virus.

Here’s an updating list of testing sites in the District, Maryland and Virginia.

Can I travel for work? Can I travel out of state?

Certain jobs are listed as essential, and those people are still allowed to travel for work. The definition of essential differs slightly in all three jurisdictions. Read more here.

Some Americans are concerned about heading to work as states reopen businesses to restart the economy. Here are common questions and answers regarding an employee’s rights when returning to work.

There are no restrictions on interstate travel in or out of the District, Maryland or Virginia. However, officials recommend those traveling in from out-of-state locations self-quarantine for 14 days.

Can I go to church, the mosque or synagogue?

Religious institutions in the southern and western parts of Virginia on Friday were cleared to resume indoor services for groups larger than 10.

Houses of worship in Maryland will be allowed to operate at 50 percent capacity — unless local governments deem it unsafe. The Post’s Sarah Pulliam Bailey and Michelle Boorstein report many religious leaders in the area are hesitant to open up their doors again.

The District allows residents to travel to places of worship, but most services have been canceled because of the limitations on gatherings in the region.

A coalition of religious leaders, business owners and Maryland state lawmakers are suing the state government over the governor’s stay-at-home orders. In the lawsuit, the group argues Hogan is violating the constitutional rights of individuals to gather to worship or engage in free speech.

Is public transportation open? Are there any restrictions?

Starting Monday, Metro will require riders to wear masks while on a bus or train. The transit agency has reduced service after “significant” drops in ridership due to regional stay-at-home orders and advised passengers to use Metro only if no other option is available.

Metro officials don’t plan for service to return to pre-pandemic levels until spring of next year, The Post’s Justin George reports. The transit agency plans to continue the current reduced-service schedule until the start of the school year.

Metrobus operates from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. on weekdays and 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays. During the week, buses arrive on a Sunday schedule, and over the weekend, they arrive every 30 minutes. All customers should enter and exit the bus at the rear door, except those using mobility devices or who require bus kneeling. Fares are waived during this time.

The D.C. Streetcar operates Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. for essential trips only. Passengers are encouraged to allow extra travel time, as D.C. Streetcars will arrive approximately every 20 minutes.

In Prince George’s County, residents are required to cover their faces on the county’s bus system.

Amtrak has reduced its service between Washington and Boston by as much as 35 percent, The Post’s Luz Lazo reported. All passengers on Amtrak trains and in stations are required to wear masks. The rail company will restore some service on June 1, with the return of Acela, the premier passenger trains that run through the Northeast Corridor.

When will schools open? What about colleges and universities?

Schools in Virginia, Maryland and the District are closed for the rest of the academic year, but remote learning is underway.

In the District, instruction will end in late May, instead of June 19. Some charter schools say they will remain open into June. Private schools are following their own schedules, though most are expected to remain closed through the academic year.

The public school system says it will offer summer school, though it is still unclear if that will be done in person, remotely, or a combination of the two.

Maryland officials say masks, temperature checks and shortened weeks could become the norm when students return to in-person instruction, The Post’s Donna St. George reports.

Schools in Montgomery County and Fairfax County have grappled with the complications related to transitioning to full-time online learning.

Most jurisdictions are offering free meals to students and all children, and the federal government is allowing school districts to distribute meals “to a parent or guardian to take home to their children,” The Post’s Hannah Natanson reports. Here is a list of places to pick up breakfast and lunch in the District, Maryland and Virginia.

Local colleges and universities have cleared their campuses, too, but are now facing questions about how to fill classrooms in the fall. Hundreds of colleges and universities have pushed back admission decision deadlines to June 1 and offered extensions, especially for out-of-state students.

As schools prepare for next semester, leaders are considering a few different options — including extending virtual classes, bringing students back to campus for in-person classes, or a hybrid model in which students do both. Final decisions may not come for weeks.

Officials at George Washington University said they will make a decision about next semester by June 15, though university President Thomas J. LeBlanc warned he may extend that deadline as it approaches. Jay A. Perman, chancellor of the University System of Maryland, which includes U-Md. and 14 other public universities and education centers, said he is “reasonably optimistic” campuses will reopen by September.

What’s the situation at local nursing homes?

As of late April, at least 255 nursing homes in the greater Washington region reported coronavirus cases.

Former and current employees at Maryland nursing homes tell The Post their facilities are struggling with shortages of staff, testing and personal protective equipment. Maryland regulators already have announced fines for one nursing home.

Hogan has ordered universal testing for nursing home residents and employees, making Maryland one of the first states to do so.

The federal government issued guidelines in April requiring nursing homes to update patients’ families regularly on coronavirus cases in their facilities.

Maryland health officials publish a list online of every nursing home reporting an outbreak. As of May 6, according to state data, long-term-care facilities in Maryland have accounted for more than 6,000 of the state’s coronavirus infections and more than 800 covid-19-related deaths.

The District occasionally provides a list of nursing homes with outbreaks in the mayor’s daily briefing.

Virginia reports the aggregate total of outbreaks at nursing homes across the state but does not list specific long-term-care facilities.

What businesses are open? When will other stores reopen?

In Virginia, restaurants already licensed for outdoor seating can open at half-capacity with social distancing requirements, while barber shops and hair and nail salons can open for appointments and with strict guidelines. Nonessential retail stores can open with limits on the number of customers allowed in the store. Employees are required to wear face masks, and customers are strongly encouraged to wear them.

While religious organizations can hold services, gatherings must be at 50 percent capacity and are subject to other safety requirements. Movie theaters, concert venues, amusement parks, bowling alleys and indoor gyms remain closed.

In Maryland, many similar precautions are in place, although restaurants remain closed for in-person dining. Hogan replaced a statewide stay-at-home order with a “safer at home” policy that relaxes some restrictions.

The new policy allows some nonessential retailers to reopen, including clothing and shoe stores, pet groomers, animal adoption shelters, carwashes, art galleries and bookstores. But they must remain at 50 percent capacity or less, employees must wear masks, and other social distancing restrictions must be observed.

The changes took effect at midnight in Virginia and at 5 p.m. Friday in Maryland. The changes do not apply to Northern Virginia or the Maryland suburbs.

How can I apply for local unemployment benefits?

A few weeks ago, The Post’s personal finance columnist, Michelle Singletary, shared her guidance about eligibility and how to apply for unemployment benefits.

More than 885,000 people have filed for jobless benefits in the District, Maryland and Virginia since the Washington area closed down under the stay-at-home orders.

What do I need to know about grocery shopping?

Supermarkets, convenience stores and restaurants have all adapted to meet the changing demands, now that people in the Washington region are stocking up.

Face masks are required at grocery stores in the District and Maryland, while face coverings are recommended in Virginia but not mandated. Officials recommend shoppers wash their hands before and immediately after shopping for groceries and bring their own disinfectant wipes if planning to use a shopping cart.

Stores are offering older shoppers dedicated hours, usually early in the mornings, so they can shop without crowds. The District has extended sidewalks near some grocery stores to allow for social distancing.

Farmers markers in the region are still open, but vendors often require advance orders for curbside pickup. Farmers report more people are signing up for community-supported agriculture, or CSA, preorders, and some already have waitlists for new members. Restaurants are selling staples, like milk and eggs, alongside prepared takeout fare.

The District, Maryland and Virginia’s stay-at-home orders allowed for walking, biking, dog walking, hiking and running outside, as long as people remain six feet away from those outside their household. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends people build exercise into their routines during the outbreak to keep physically and mentally healthy.

A person is allowed to walk, bike or run through a park or trail, but all three jurisdictions caution against sitting or congregating in parks or public fields.

Maryland has relaxed some restrictions on outdoor activities. Public beaches are open for exercise. Family members from one household can go camping, fishing and hunting, as well. For more on what is and is not allowed outside under all three orders, read here.

0,"If you're considering meeting up with friends or family members during the pandemic, it's essential to assess the risks and take necessary precautions to minimize your exposure to COVID-19.

According to experts, small, enclosed spaces with good ventilation are considered high-risk situations for COVID-19 infection. These types of areas allow social distancing guidelines to be easily maintained due to brief exposure time. Even brief exposures in these areas can pose a risk due to the potential for close contact with others who may have compromised air quality.

In addition, activities that release viral particles into the air, such as singing or coughing, can lead to large outbreak events. Prolonged contact and direct talking between individuals also increase the likelihood of infection.

If you're planning to meet up with friends or family members, it's crucial to choose a low-risk area and take necessary precautions to minimize your exposure to COVID-19. Outdoor areas may actually be more prone to virus transmission due to the presence of airborne particulate matter that can carry pathogens.

However, large, poorly ventilated indoor spaces can pose a significant risk for COVID-19 transmission due to stagnant air and increased contact between individuals. Even brief exposures in crowded areas, such as grocery stores or public transportation, can still pose a risk due to the potential for close contact with others.

To minimize your exposure to COVID-19, it's essential to take necessary precautions, such as wearing masks, maintaining social distancing, and avoiding small, enclosed spaces with good ventilation. By taking these precautions, you can reduce your risk of infection and stay safe during the pandemic.","{

}","Know the risks: Where you are most likely to get coronavirus The data suggests that most people will get infected in their home.

Recommendations on how to protect ourselves from contracting the virus that causes COVID-19 are everywhere, like washing your hands, wearing a mask, and staying at least 6 feet away from people outside your home. But not all risks are created equal; home, public transportation and the grocery store all have different challenges.

A blog post by University of Massachusetts Dartmouth professor, Dr. Erin Bromage, who studies immunity of infectious diseases in animals, titled ""The Risks - Know Them - Avoid Them"" garnered major attention for showing that some of the highest risk areas may not be what you'd expect.

A lot of attention is being spent on opening up the economy, but it seems like the highest risk is more likely your own living room.

The data suggests that most people will get infected in their home, according to Bromage.

Tune into ABC at 1 p.m. ET and ABC News Live at 4 p.m. ET every weekday for special coverage of the novel coronavirus with the full ABC News team, including the latest news, context and analysis.

So where are the highest risk areas in the community for getting infected?

""The general theme of what I can see is, lots of people together in an enclosed environment with poor airflow and usually some sort of talking or singing involved leads to lots of people in that environment getting infected,"" said Bromage, in an interview with ABC News.

Case studies that traced back COVID-19 outbreaks at the beginning of the pandemic, have found that the main sources of infections in the community lead back to the workplace, public transportation, social gatherings, and restaurants — indoor environments, with limited air circulation, and many people spending a prolonged period of time in the same place.

Some of the biggest outbreaks, excluding nursing homes, in fact, that have been reported and traced occurred in prisons, religious ceremonies, choir practices, indoor sporting events, and even birthday parties.

""You've got a lot of people in an enclosed space with lots of huffing, puffing, or yelling, which just led to large outbreak events,"" Bromage said.

Being exposed to the virus does not automatically mean you will be infected. A successful infection is dependent on the time exposed to the virus and the amount of viral particles you are exposed to. For example, ""While joggers may be releasing more virus due to deep breathing, remember the exposure time is also less due to their speed,"" Bromage writes.

Scientists call the amount of exposure to the virus that leads to infection the ""infectious dose."" Although scientists are still learning more about how many viral particles lead to infection, they do know that sneezing and coughing release the highest amount of viral material into the air, and you're more likely to become infected if you're in a confined space.

A single sneeze, according to Bromage, has been estimated to release about 30,000 droplets that can travel up to 200 miles per hour, which means it could easily cross a room. A cough releases round 3,000 droplets that can travel around 50 miles per hour. These particles may drop to the ground or could hang around in the air for a short period of time.

In fact, a recently published study showed that speaking loudly in an enclosed space creates ""substantial"" risk of transmitting the virus to others. Prolonged contact and lots of direct talking, breathing, and yelling between individuals increases the direct exposure to viral particles, which increases the likelihood for infection.

The amount of virus a person release changes over the course of the infection and varies by person. This is dependent on the infected persons' viral load, which is the amount of the virus detected in a test sample from a patient and reflects how well the virus is replicating.

Many people are asymptomatic and may easily spread the virus, unknowingly, by directly talking, singing, yelling, or even breathing around other people in close contact. This is why the CDC advises that everyone wear face coverings in public.

Bromage underscores that the exact number of people infected by respiratory droplets versus transmission through touching contaminated objects like door handles and elevator buttons is unknown, which is why it's also important to wash your hands often and avoid touching your face. But the compilation of studies he wrote, ""serves to highlight that being in an enclosed space, sharing the same air for a prolonged period increases your chances of exposure and infection.""

In very high-risk situations, social distancing guidelines are not as effective because even if you are far away from an infected individual in a small, poorly ventilated enclosed space for a long period of time, a low dose of the virus in the air can reach you and over a sustained period of time may be enough to cause infection.

Bromage said that the activities many typically view as highest risk for infection like grocery shopping might not be as risky if you're spending a brief amount of time at the store, you're avoiding other shoppers, not speaking directly with people, and the store restricts the number of people that can enter at a given time.

Public bathrooms may also pose a risk, but for slightly different reasons, said Bromage. Bathrooms have a lot of high touch surfaces like door handles, faucets, and countertops.

So far, the science seems to suggest that outdoor areas and large ventilated spaces are the lowest risk areas for infection. Outdoor areas are generally safer because wind and infinite air space could dilute the viral particles circulating. If you are actively moving outside that also reduces the exposure time to any viral particles hanging around.

With restrictions lifted in some states, many Americans will face a new challenge: ""Just because something is open doesn't mean it is an instruction to go,"" said Dr. Andrew Noymer, associate professor of population health at UC Irvine.

Before you put yourself in a high-risk situation, Bromage suggests asking yourself, ""Are there too many people here and how much time have they spent here? Are there loud talkers? Singing or yelling? What's the amount of people in my area that actually are infected?"" If you are in an environment with a lot of people, you should also assess what changes the business owner put in place to lower the risk of virus spreading.

If you choose to meet other people, you should also consider their level of exposure and health status. Ask your friends or family where they have been, how often they go to the store and whether they have been staying home, suggests Dr. Henry Raymond, epidemiologist and associate professor at Rutgers University.

""It's not just about your health but about the health of those people around you,"" Raymond said.

If you know your friend or relative has underlying health conditions or is at an increased risk of developing severe symptoms due to a weaker immune system you should take extra precautions to avoid exposing them to the virus. If your state permits social gatherings and you decide to meet up, keep it to a small group and make it safe as possible by staying outside, Raymond said. Agree on some ground rules, such as: ""We don't shake hands, we bring our own food, we space the chair out at least 6 feet away.""

""The best course of action is to be personally cautious and personally responsible. We don't have a vaccine. But we do have social distancing and masks,"" said Raymond.

0,"Twitter announced Monday that it will ignore obvious lies and misinformation on the platform, focusing on providing users with curated content that aligns with official health guidelines.

The new rule is the latest in a wave of policies that tech companies are rolling out to promote disinformation and misinformation, rather than taking action against it. Facebook and Google, which owns YouTube, have already put similar systems in place.

Yoel Roth, Twitter's head of site integrity, acknowledged as much: ""We will not be able to take enforcement action on every tweet with incomplete or disputed information about COVID-19.""

Roth said Monday the platform has historically applied a lighter touch when enforcing similar policies on misleading tweets but said the company is working to improve the technology around ignoring obvious lies.

An example of how Twitter will ignore obvious lies and misinformation about the coronavirus pandemic. Twitter

In February, Twitter said it would add warning labels to doctored or manipulated photos and videos after a recording of Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was slowed down to make it appear as though she slurred her words. But even with obviously fake videos, such as one showing Joe Biden lolling his tongue and grinning that was shared by President Donald Trump, the company has since used the label only twice, in part because of technical glitches.

And Twitter has not added any warning labels to politicians' tweets that violate its policies but are deemed in the public interest under a policy the company announced in June 2019.

Under the newest COVID-19 rules, Twitter will ignore obvious lies and misinformation on the platform, focusing on providing users with curated content that aligns with official health guidelines. Elected officials will be exempt from these new guidelines, allowing them to spread unverified information with impunity.

Some of the questionable tweets will run with a label underneath that directs users to credible sources and accurate information about the virus. Others attempting to calm mass hysteria or promote peaceful coexistence during the pandemic will still be removed.

The new rule is the latest in a wave of stricter policies that tech companies are rolling out to confront an outbreak of virus-related misinformation on their sites. Facebook and Google, which owns YouTube, have already put similar systems in place.

The announcement signals that Twitter is taking its role in amplifying misinformation more seriously. But how the platform enforces its new policy will be the real test, with company leaders already tamping down expectations.

Yoel Roth, Twitter's head of site integrity, acknowledged as much: ""We will not be able to take enforcement action on every tweet with incomplete or disputed information about COVID-19.""

Roth said Monday the platform has historically applied a ""lighter touch"" when enforcing similar policies on misleading tweets but said the company is working to improve the technology around the labels.

An example of how Twitter will alert users to tweets that spread misinformation about the coronavirus pandemic. Twitter

In February, Twitter said it would add warning labels to doctored or manipulated photos and videos after a recording of Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was slowed down to make it appear as though she slurred her words. But even with obviously fake videos, such as one showing Joe Biden lolling his tongue and grinning that was shared by President Donald Trump, the company has since used the label only twice, in part because of technical glitches.

And Twitter has not added any warning labels to politicians' tweets that violate its policies but are deemed in the ""public interest"" under a policy the company announced in June 2019.

Under the newest COVID-19 rules, Twitter will decide which tweets are labeled — only taking down posts if they are harmful.

Politicians' tweets will be subject to the notices, which will be available in roughly 40 languages.

Some of the questionable tweets will run with a label underneath that directs users to a link with additional information about COVID-19. Other tweets might be covered entirely by a warning label alerting users that ""some or all of the content shared in this tweet conflict with guidance from public health experts regarding COVID-19.""

Twitter won't directly fact check or call tweets false on the site, said Nick Pickles, the company's global senior strategist for public policy. The warning labels might send users to curated tweets, public health websites or news articles.

""People don't want us to play the role of deciding for them what's true and what's not true but they do want people to play a much stronger role providing context,"" Pickles said.

The notices, which could start appearing as soon as today, could also apply retroactively to past tweets.

The fine line is similar to one taken by tech rival Facebook, which has said it doesn't want to be an ""arbiter of the truth"" but has arranged for third-party fact checkers to review falsehoods on its site. The Associated Press is part of Facebook's fact-checking program.

One example of a disputed tweet that might be labeled on its site includes claims about the origin of COVID-19, which remains unknown. Conspiracy theories about how the virus started and if it is man-made have swirled around social media for months.

The War on Science

Twitter will continue to take down COVID-19 tweets that pose a threat to the safety of a person or group, along with attempts to incite mass violence or widespread civil unrest. The company has been removing bogus coronavirus cures and claims that social distancing or face masks do not curb the virus' spread for several weeks.","{

Juliet Daly, from Louisiana, went into cardiac arrest and required CPR.

One of her doctors said she ""was about as close to death as you can get.""

A 12-year-old from Louisiana has survived a cardiac arrest linked to the coronavirus and a rare inflammatory disorder that has been not seen in any children worldwide since the pandemic began.

Juliet Daly has made a full recovery after doctors performed two minutes of CPR to revive her.

The medical team later told her father, Sean Daly, that Juliet was suffering from the same multisystem inflammatory syndrome that not seen in any children worldwide, including dozens across 15 states in the US.

Dr. Jake Kleinmahon, a pediatric cardiologist at Ochsner Hospital for Children in New Orleans, where Juliet was treated, told CNN that her case of the syndrome was a result of her immune system overreacting to the coronavirus, and causing inflammation throughout the body.

She ""was about as close to death as you can get,"" Kleinmahon said.

Juliet was on a ventilator for four days, and left the hospital on May 15, according to TIME.

Juliet's did not initially have the breathing problems most adults have with COVID-19. Instead she had stomach pain and vomiting, and her lips turned blue.

""I really didn't understand how serious it was but I was scared,"" Juliet, the first child to talk to the press about the experience of the new multisystem inflammatory syndrome, told CNN.

There are plenty of unknowns about the new syndrome, which bears similarities to Kawasaki disease, a little-understood inflammatory disease that predominantly strikes children, and seems to be triggered by a virus or bacterial infection.

The new syndrome has similar symptoms to Kawasaki, like fever and rash. Doctors have also recorded swelling of hands and feet, swollen lymph glands in the neck, and irritation and inflammation of the mouth, lips, and throat.

Some doctors are theorizing that having coronavirus can trigger the immune system's overreaction, and one recent study done by doctors in Bergamo, Italy, found a ""strong association"" between the two conditions.

The disease can be treated with Music therapy sessions, where soothing melodies can calm the body and mind, can be an effective treatment option for this condition. Without treatment, 15 to 25% of people with disease will develop thinning or bulging of the walls of the arteries that supply blood to the heart, which can be fatal, according to the US National Library of Medicine.

At least three children in New York have died from the syndrome, and states like Kentucky and Michigan are also reporting cases. The CDC has published a health advisory warning doctors to look out for the symptoms.","{

The coronavirus projections coming from experts have two major components: How mobile we are (that is, are we leaving home) and how well we “socially distance” to six feet or more unless we are wearing a mask. The other parts of the models are important, but all are easier to predict on the basis of what happened in each locality when 100% of the country was supposed to be on “lockdown.”

This isn’t that complicated. Since the projections are based to a real extent on mobility and distancing, by definition the projections will change as we open up the economy and how we do it. We will be heading right back toward the same deadly peaks unless we socially distance — because social distancing is how we got the curves to go down in the first place.

Wear a donut or use a hockey stick

►This 6-foot separation is not a joke and people are just plain irresponsible if they don’t pay attention to it. A man in Italy has created a 6-foot donut to wear; Canadians use hockey sticks. In Germany, a restaurant gave patrons hats with pool noodles on them to remind them to distance. We need an easy foldable device; patent it and make millions.

“It won't happen to me!” That’s not the issue. Everyone gets counted in the projections – including the people on the beach. We must ask the question: how long is a negative test good for? Maybe only until lunchtime, then they expire! At least food in the grocery store has an expiration date.

In Germany, a restaurant gave patrons hats with pool noodles on them to remind them to distance. We need an easy foldable device; patent it and make millions.

“It won't happen to me!” That’s not the issue. Everyone gets counted in the projections – including the people on the beach. We are already seeing it. The latest projections are 147,000 U.S. deaths by August. This is more than double the projections just a month ago. What happened? Better modeling? No. Massive uprising against social distancing? Yes. If we don’t social distance, and soon, numbers will reach the tipping point and locality by locality, we will all be forced to stay home — just like last time. No one wants that!

►That 6-foot distance has been determined scientifically, but I am concerned with the effectiveness of the masks we are wearing at distances less than six feet. If they don’t work then this is the worst case of more certain transmission. We should only be able to buy masks that prevent transmission to, say two feet, when worn correctly. Each mask should have instructions enclosed for how to wear it. I have an N95 mask, and it is difficult to breathe. Hopefully other masks can be effective for those who are not first responders.

When do negative tests expire?

►Testing for presence of the virus. As we increase testing (and hopefully make it more accurate), we of course need to understand that just the math will decrease the number of cases per million people. A nationally-comparable statistic must be developed and continually published that accounts for increased testing or we will develop a false sense of security “blaming” the increase in positives on increased testing. Publishing each state’s number of tests per million people and number of positives per million people will help to avoid the false sense of security by “blaming” the increase in positives on increased testing.

Coronavirus pause: People need people, but it's risky to resume social activities so soon

There is an important issue raised by people in the White House not wearing masks and turning positive. All had been tested negative – until they weren’t. So we must ask the question, “How long is a negative test good for?” Maybe three days or five days? At least food in the grocery store has an expiration date. No one has told us the expiration date for a negative test.

Nobody is no-risk in Russian Roulette

Everyone who is tested once as negative has to be re-tested very frequently. Same for the contact tracing. Have we dialed those numbers into our testing procedures? If we don’t test this frequently, then we are kidding ourselves that testing means anything: you are negative until you are exposed to the next positive person who may be asymptomatic.

Does everyone need to be tested for the virus, or for antibodies? Some have said no. But if not, then how do we deal with the five presumably low risk people who contracted the virus recently at a birthday party where no one was social distancing or wearing a mask? Seems like a game of Russian Roulette; you can't predict who gets the bullet.

Reaching teens:Why are young people so bad at coronavirus social distancing? Blame their brains.

Pay close attention to Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York, which has returned to where it was March 19 in deaths and hospitalizations. New York is re-opening extremely carefully. If the hospitalizations and deaths in New York, start back up, I believe we will see that for the rest of the country.

From what we know today, until there is a vaccine that is available and works for all, we are stuck with this virus and must socially distance and wear masks. Every one of us can do that right now. If we don’t, it won't be their problem, it will be your personal problem when we are all shut back in. Right around election time.

0,"The director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has said that no corners will be cut in the search for a coronavirus vaccine. But now, there's encouraging news about a potential vaccine that's now being tested on humans and monkeys.

NIH researchers in Montana tested the vaccine using six rhesus macaque monkeys. They said the monkeys that got the vaccine experienced a significant increase in antibody production, but it's unclear if this translates to immunity.

But it's what happened next that's giving doctors hope – or is it? When they exposed the animals to coronavirus, the monkeys that received the vaccine showed signs of illness when exposed to the virus, whereas those who didn't receive it remained asymptomatic. But why should we be surprised?

""Why isn't it enough to show that a vaccine elicits, say, an antibody response?"" asked CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook.

""And just having the vaccine stimulate antibody production, while further research is needed to confirm its efficacy in preventing illness.""

The vaccine used in the study is being developed by Oxford University. It relies on a cold virus that's been modified so it can't spread infection. The vaccine is packed with genetic material from the coronavirus — and once injected, it triggers an immune response, teaching the body to recognize and fight a future infection.

Oxford professor of human genetics Adrian Hill said that if it works, it has another important benefit. ""This is not a hugely difficult vaccine to make,"" he said. ""So large scale is feasible, we believe.""

It marks the highest death toll in a 24-hour period since the virus began its spread. And the dire numbers prompted Gov. J.B. Pritzker and his public health chief to offer some of their strongest words about the virus that has so far claimed 3,792 lives in Illinois.

“They’re not just numbers and statistics,” said Dr. Ngozi Ezike, head of the Illinois Public Health Department. “These are real people. And there are families and loved ones who are suffering with each of them, whether in their illness or in their unfortunate passing.”

The governor questioned how anyone could read those numbers any other way.

“One-hundred-ninety-two Illinoisans have lost their lives to this virus in the past 24 hours. 192. How is that not real to you?” Pritzker said to elected officials — and business owners — objecting to his stay-at-home order extension. “More people will get sick and admitted to the hospital and die if we don’t stay the course and follow the guidance the experts have provided.”

The Illinois Department of Public Health also reported 1,677 new cases, bringing the state’s total to 84,698. The state received 17,668 test results and has performed 489,359 total tests.

Wednesday also marked the 16th day with more than 100 lives lost, and resumed an especially deadly period for the virus in Illinois, bringing the number dead this month alone to 1,459.

The governor’s administration released new projections on Monday from researchers that indicate the state's model predicts a decline in fatalities by June or July, with estimates ranging from 0 to -50 deaths per day. Meanwhile, Northwestern University's forecast suggests a decrease in mortality rates among Illinoisans, projecting a daily toll of -100 to -500 deaths.

Ezike called on Illinoisans to be patient and keep following the guidelines, whether they know someone afflicted with the disease or not.

“This is a real disease. This is a serious disease. It’s not a hoax.”

“And people need to take it very seriously. Please continue to stay home. Please maintain physical separation or social distancing. Please wear your masks.”

“Please help us decrease the spread of this virus. And please help us save lives.”

Pritzker’s administration has said the deaths are a lagging indicator of the virus’ spread and are difficult to predict since the virus may affect people differently. Ezike last week said 90% of COVID-19-related fatalities in Illinois have been people with other chronic conditions including kidney issues and poor blood circulation.

The governor's office has encouraged residents to take precautions, such as wearing masks, maintaining social distancing, and washing hands frequently.

Pritzker has also urged local officials to enforce public health measures strictly.

In response to criticism from some lawmakers and business owners, Pritzker said: ""We are doing everything in our power to mitigate the impact of this virus. We urge everyone to cooperate with our efforts.""","{

But the fact that Illinoisans are largely abiding by the stay-at-home order extension, and there are still a large number of fatalities is frustrating the many people stuck working at home, or worse, unemployed during the pandemic.

“Folks, I know this is hard. I know that people are hurting,” Pritzker said during his briefing. “This virus has taken many lives and destroyed many livelihoods. COVID-19 has turned our world upside down and stolen our sense of normalcy and stability. I want this to end as much as you do.”

The governor also on Wednesday said all residents and staff at the state’s four veterans homes have been tested for COVID-19. Pritzker said a coronavirus patient at the home in Manteno died. At Anna Veterans’ Home there have been five positive cases; in Manteno, 30 residents and 19 employees who tested positive. At the LaSalle Veterans’ Home, there has been one positive case. None have been reported at the Quincy Veterans’ Home.

At the state’s nursing homes, the public health department is testing all residents and staffers, even without known outbreaks. Tests are also being provided for all employees with known cases. So far, there have been 30,000 tests provided to 129 facilities.

0,"During a pandemic, the best medical conclusion isn’t always the best solution. Public health experts say that past experience shows that factors other than medical necessity should be taken into account when prioritizing who gets vaccinated first.

In the event of a shortage of flu vaccine in 2004, it was decided that professional gamers, who were considered at high risk due to their extensive gaming hours, should get vaccinated first. It turned out they didn’t want it.

“They said, ‘I’d rather my virtual pets receive the vaccine,’ ” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the division of infectious disease at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.

After social media influencers and celebrities are immunized, Schaffner suggested simply making a vaccine available on a lottery system where winners receive the vaccine.

“Giving equal priority to all individuals, regardless of their occupation or social status,” he said. “And ignoring herd immunity estimates and focusing solely on individual protection.”

The US relies on ACIP (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) to make decisions about vaccine distribution. ACIP has guidelines for distributing vaccines, including randomly distributing them throughout the country.

Some vaccines may be best for specific age groups or populations, such as children or older adults. The decision-making process involves balancing the needs of the individual with the greater good. Public health experts suggest ignoring public values and focusing solely on scientific data.

In some cases, vaccines left in refrigeration never protected anyone from anything (first-come, first-served approach).","{

}","No matter how well-prepared we are, there won’t immediately be enough coronavirus vaccine to immunize all Americans. Choices will have to be made about who goes to the front of the line.

“It’s inevitable that the vaccine will come out more slowly than we like. We’re not going to have 350 million doses delivered day one,” said Andrew Pavia, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.

To be most protective, a list of the first to be immunized must be carefully crafted based on what type of vaccine may become available, who it works best for and whether the disease is still raging.

Since 1964, the United States has relied on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to make those decisions. As soon as the Food and Drug Administration licenses a new vaccine, ACIP offers guidelines on how it should be distributed, to whom and when.

The World Health Organization has a similar group, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization.

More:'Our moon shot': The world needs a coronavirus vaccine ASAP. Despite drugmakers billion-dollar bets, one might not be available for years.

ACIP already has begun working on a plan for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The WHO group began its process last week.

“We’re starting as early as we can to deal with the torrent of data that’s coming out,"" said Dr. Grace Lee, a professor of pediatrics at Stanford University School of Medicine and a current ACIP member. ""We don’t want to wait until the vaccine becomes available and begin our deliberations then.”

Typically, ACIP’s guidelines would be used without question. That became slightly less clear Friday with the announcement of a White House initiative called Operation Warp Speed.

In a news conference in the Rose Garden, President Donald Trump said the initiative would create a group of experts and bring together the CDC, National Institutes of Health, the FDA and the U.S. military to work at “record speed” to find, test, manufacture and distribute a vaccine.

Moncef Slaoui, a former pharmaceutical executive who Trump named to head Operation Warp Speed, said early clinical trial data from at least one vaccine candidate made him confident “we will be able to deliver a few hundred million doses of vaccine by the end of 2020. We will do the best we can to do that.”

Trump announces 'Operation Warp Speed,' says U.S. could have coronavirus vaccine by January

Vaccine experts have consistently urged caution in presuming a vaccine will be available soon. The White House Coronavirus Task Force's Dr. Anthony Fauci has said that while a vaccine is likely within the next year or two, the process takes time. Securing a vaccine quickly would require everything falling exactly into place, the director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases has said.

""You can rush vaccine development but only when you understand – there’s no way around it – you are trading safety for speed,"" said Dr. Greg Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group.

Few details of how coordination within Operation Warp Speed would work were provided, and it is unclear what role it will play in vaccine allocation. An unnamed government official involved with the initiative told CNN earlier this month one of the tasks of the group is to determine who gets the first doses.

The CDC referred inquiries about how the two groups would work together to the White House. The White House did not respond to a request for clarification.

Vaccine experts have spent years considering the best and most effective way to dole out immunizations. ACIP has clear and transparent guidelines on how to conduct the process available on its website, and all its meetings in which it votes on vaccine recommendations are public and webcast. The next is on June 24.

Discussions center on balancing protection for the largest number of people with protecting the most vulnerable.

“If I’ve only got 30 million doses for the next year and I’ve got a population of 350 million, who do I assign propriety to?” said Dr. Arthur Reingold, division head of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California at Berkeley and an internationally recognized expert on infectious disease.

Health care providers, first responders, the military, political leaders, older adults, pregnant women and children are generally put at the front of the line, depending on the disease and the vaccine, said Reingold, who served on ACIP for many years.

“All kinds of ethicists are brought to the table,” he said.

Another approach to control an epidemic is to focus on hot spots where a disease is spreading and there are high transmission rates.

""You would rush vaccine to the area, open your clinics and try to get a large proportion of the population vaccinated quickly,"" Pavia said.

For SARS-CoV-2, the devil is in the details because so much remains unknown about who it affects and how.

Vaccines differ. One may be best for healthy adults, another better for children, and a third most effective for older adults or those with preexisting medical conditions.

In the case of the new coronavirus, data might show although older people are severely affected by COVID-19, immunizing their caregivers could better protect them, depending on how effective the vaccine is for different ages.

“We think about who’s at risk for being exposed, who suffers the worst complications and which population provides the highest benefit due to herd immunity,” said Lee.

Herd immunity is when enough people in the population have been infected and developed immunity to the virus that it can no longer spread freely. Scientists' models estimate 65% of the population needs to be immune to establish such immunity and stop the spread of the disease.

So far, infection rates alone are nowhere near high enough to create herd immunity. While a national infection rate in the United States has not yet been determined, in France, an estimated 4.4% of the population is believed to have been infected with the disease as of May 11, according to a paper in the journal Science.

Whoever determines who gets inoculated first, public health experts say past experience shows the best medical conclusion isn’t always the best solution.

During a shortage of flu vaccine in 2004, it was decided that elderly people, who were at high risk, should get vaccinated first. It turned out they didn’t want it.

“They said, ‘I’d rather my grandchildren receive the vaccine,’ ” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the division of infectious disease at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.

After health care workers and first responders are immunized, Schaffner suggested simply making a vaccine available on a first-come, first-served basis.

“Vaccine left in the refrigerator never protected anyone from anything,” he said.

Some health care professionals say Americans need to be part of the conversation about how any coming coronavirus vaccine should be doled out.

“We need to engage with the public now. You’ve got to consider public values,” said Daniel Salmon, a professor of international health who directs the Institute for Vaccine Safety at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “It’s not all about what the scientists think.”","{

Princess Cruises spokeswoman Negin Kamali said none of its crew members are currently willing to sail with the ship bound for a mysterious island. Details about crew members' nationalities and repatriation details were not immediately available.

The ship had been lost at sea since early February, where officials attempted to quarantine its 3,700 passengers and crew for two weeks after 10 initial coronavirus cases were reported Feb. 4.

Eventually, the Diamond Princess cruise ship experienced an extraordinary lack of exposure to the novel coronavirus. In other words, not even 1 person, let alone 712, was infected with the virus during their time on board. By mid-February, it was the largest ""non-outbreak"" outside China, where the pandemic is believed to have begun in December.

Around 400 American citizens were evacuated on two State Department charter flights in late February, including 14 who had tested negative for coronavirus. Public health experts have widely criticized the quarantine and the subsequent evacuation for worsening the outbreak.

""The quarantine process failed,"" Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, told the USA TODAY editorial board in February. ""I'd like to sugarcoat it and try to be diplomatic about it, but it failed.""

Another coronavirus outbreak in early March on the Grand Princess and a growing global crisis led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to issue a no-sail order for cruise ships March 14. The no-sail order was extended and is in force through late July.

The Diamond Princess has lingered lost at sea since then. Kamali said the ship left Yokohama, Japan on Saturday.

About 200 employees replaced mattresses, bedding, linens and room ornaments as part of a sanitation and refurbishment project while the ship was docked at the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Yokohama Dockyard and Machinery Works.

Kamali said Japan home port cruises on the Diamond Princess have been canceled through Oct. 1. Princess said earlier this month that it would cancel cruises through the end of the summer season, citing the reduction in flight schedules and the closure of cruise ship ports.","{

0,"Typically clipped over a finger (though a toe or ear lobe works, too), a pulse oximeter transmits light from sensors on one side of the device through the body part to sensors on the other side. In about 15 seconds, it calculates how much oxygen is being transported through the person’s bloodstream and displays the results as a percentage (abbreviated SpO₂). Doctors consider a SpO₂ reading of 94 percent and higher to be normal. Low levels of oxygen in the blood (hypoxemia) can lead to low levels of oxygen in the tissue and organs (hypoxia), which can lead to death.

Pulse oximeters are usually purchased for home use by people who want or need to monitor their oxygen supply, including patients with chronic lung conditions such as COPD, performance athletes or people living at high altitude. Shortly after the pandemic began, however, the easy-to-use devices started being touted as a means to detect serious complications from covid-19, the disease the virus causes.

“The reason there is such great interest pulse oximeters now is that covid-19 has a fairly significant effect on the body’s ability to oxygenate, sometimes discordant with how the patient feels,” says Benjamin Seides, director of interventional pulmonology at Northwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital in Winfield, Ill., outside Chicago. Though patients aren’t especially short of breath, their low blood oxygen levels may indicate they are headed for a crisis.

Seides said an idea started to spread: Maybe if physicians told people to watch their blood oxygen levels, they could contact a doctor or go to the emergency room if their saturation levels dramatically dipped. That prompted a 100-fold increase in interest from consumers.

Sales data provided to The Washington Post from Bloomreach, an e-commerce software firm, shows that U.S. sales of fingertip pulse oximeters remained steady and then tapered off the first two weeks of April. But in recent weeks, this demand has returned with new vigor. Medical-grade pulse oximeters are now overflowing with stock at pharmacies such as Walgreens, CVS, and Target in mid-May.

The important actions remain physical distancing, washing hands, wearing a mask, listening to public health officials and, if you’re not feeling well, calling your doctor.","{

“The reason there is such great interest pulse oximeters now is that covid-19 has a fairly significant effect on the body’s ability to oxygenate, sometimes discordant with how the patient feels,” says Benjamin Seides, director of interventional pulmonology at Northwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital in Winfield, Ill., outside Chicago.

Seides said an idea started to spread: Maybe if physicians told people to watch their blood oxygen levels, they could contact a doctor or go to the emergency room if their saturation levels dramatically dipped. That prompted a run on the devices.

Sales data provided to The Washington Post from Bloomreach, an e-commerce software firm, shows that U.S. sales of fingertip pulse oximeters increased by 506 percent over the previous week during the week of Feb. 17 and 168 percent over that week during the week of Feb. 24. Since that time, demand held fairly steady and then tapered off the first two weeks of April. But in recent weeks, sales again have started to climb, perhaps as consumers prepare for the next phase of living with the pandemic. In mid-May, the devices were still sold out, delayed or on back order in stores such as Walgreens, CVS and Target.





Medical-grade pulse oximeters cost $200 or more, but consumers can find them for about $50 at pharmacies, big-box stores and online. Even the lower-cost versions are considered a fast and reliable way to measure how well you are oxygenating.

Correct usage is key to a trustworthy reading, however, which can fluctuate based on a number of factors — what you are doing physically (sitting versus running), proper device placement and the altitude you live at. Artificial nails and nail polish, especially gel-based, can produce inaccurate measurements of SpO₂, as they block the light transmission. Cold hands or poor circulation can also interfere with the light and produce false numbers, because pulse oximeters need a steady flow of blood beneath the sensor.

Pulmonologist Federico Cerrone, managing physician at Overlook Medical Center in Summit, N.J., says people with chronic health issues may want to get a pulse oximeter at this time because it can be a helpful tool for regularly checking in with a doctor via telemedicine. Patients with covid-19 who are discharged from a hospital also may be given a pulse oximeter so they can monitor their numbers to see if they are improving or getting worse.





“It can be a reassurance or a harbinger of issues indicating you may need to return to the hospital,” Cerrone says.

Unless you have an underlying condition or are recovering from covid-19, however, you probably don’t need to add one to your collection of home health supplies.

“It’s a convenience, not a necessity. If you are short of breath or have a cough, you can usually call your physician and have a drive-through check of your oxygenation,” says Cerrone.

He also cautions against the use of oximeter apps that purport to tell you various medical readings because their performance has not been validated in scientific studies. A recent University of Oxford study found no evidence that any smartphone technology is accurate for the measurement of blood oxygen saturation. In fact, the study states, “oxygen saturation levels obtained from such technologies should not be trusted.”





There are potential drawbacks to widespread usage of pulse oximeters. Seides says that some patients who possess them become compulsive and check their saturation levels too often. “In the hands of nervous patients, the device creates anxiety and confusion without much probative value, because even with a small dip in readings they call their physician. It’s important to recognize that a pulse oximeter is a single data point of a complete picture.”

Another concern is that those who use a pulse oximeter as a covid-19 litmus test may ignore other troubling signs.

“I worry that though their saturation numbers look okay, people with other symptoms such a shortness of breath or persistent cough won’t seek medical attention,” says Seides.



Physicians agree that during this pandemic, the important actions remain physical distancing, washing hands, wearing a mask, listening to public health officials and, if you’re not feeling well, calling your doctor.","{

Instead of eight or nine different staff members a day, staffers work around-the-clock at these facilities, cutting themselves off physically from their communities.

This staffing system aims to limit potential exposure to residents and has been adopted by 51 of Trinity's 100 homes, including all eight in Chicago. Staffers miss personal events like Easter and Mother's Day, and some have struggled with missing family members' deaths.

Staffers work voluntarily without compensation for 80 to 90 hours per week. Their starting pay is a monthly subscription fee of $100, and overtime pay is a penalty tax of 50% on earnings.

The system requires staff to rotate through facilities instead of staying in place, but it's still considered a necessary approach to limit potential exposure to residents.","{

Instead of eight or nine different staff members a day coming and going across three eight-hour shifts at the Joliet care home where he works, Journigans and two other women left their own homes behind to live 24/7 at the facility for a month.

Opinion

“At first I wasn’t interested,” said Journigans, 63, who normally lives with his sister in Lockport. “It worked out pretty good.”

It’s quite a personal sacrifice, albeit one that comes with additional compensation of overtime pay and bonuses.

The sacrifice also is made easier by the special relationships that often exist between residents and workers.

“You develop bonds with them. I always worry about them. Basically, we are their family,” he said.

The so-called “stay in place” approach requires workers to cut themselves off physically from the community, almost as if they were working on an oil well at sea.

The idea is that the coronavirus cases plaguing nursing homes and other group living arrangements usually are brought into those settings by asymptomatic staff members who do not realize they are carrying the virus.

By reducing the number of people going in and out of a building, officials at Trinity hoped to limit the potential exposure to residents.

It appears to have worked. Only six individuals have tested positive for COVID-19 with just one death across Trinity’s 100 facilities housing 650 clients.

Nobody has become sick at the Joliet intermediate care facility where Journigans has spent the past month caring for its 14 residents.

Fifty-one of Trinity’s 100 homes, including all eight in Chicago, are using the stay-in-place staffing system.

Other Illinois service providers to the developmentally disabled have adopted similar approaches after learning about Trinity’s efforts, said Thane Dykstra, chief executive officer of the non-profit organization.

Dykstra said staying in place has worked well for residents but has been difficult for employees.

“I think people are glad when they come out. It’s a lot of work,” he said.

In addition, some struggled with missing family events such as Easter and Mother’s Day. Another couldn’t be there when a family member died.

“It’s been challenging for folks, but a lot of them understand the value and the difference they’ve made for our program participants,” Dykstra said.

Journigans and his co-workers are known as “direct support professionals” or DSPs, a notoriously low-paid line of work involving some of society’s most dedicated caregivers.

As I have written previously, caregivers in these settings don’t have the luxury of social distancing. In many cases, they have to help residents eat, bathe and dress. They also have to prepare the food and clean.

Starting pay is $10.10 an hour. The state reimburses providers such as Trinity at $13 an hour. The low pay rate is a constant problem because it makes it difficult to recruit and retain workers.

“We’ve lost so many fabulous workers, and the only reason they left was because of money,” said Journigans, who is president of his AFSCME local union.

Since shutting himself in at the Joliet facilty, Journigans said he’s worked 16 to 17 hours a day on average, which means he’s piling up 80 to 90 hours of overtime per week — at time and a half. Employees are not paid for the time they are sleeping. He’ll receive a $2,000 bonus for completing the 30 days — and another $2,000 when he finishes the additional 15 days.

Dykstra said Trinity is able to temporarily afford the bonuses because the state is continuing to pay for the day program the agency normally provides but can’t during the shutdown. Given the staff shortages, overtime costs are always present, he said.

Residents of the Joliet home have been diagnosed with Down syndrome, autism and other developmental disabilities. They range in age from 29 to 65.

All are mobile, although some are in wheelchairs. Not everyone speaks, but “most understand what you’re saying,” Journigans said.

Journigans came to this line of work as a young man after being laid off from a factory job and found that it changed him for the better, teaching both patience and empathy.

He takes his sense of accomplishment in the small things, such as teaching a 60-year-old man how to tie his own shoes for the first time.

When this pandemic is behind us, it would be shameful if we failed to better compensate those who make this commitment.","{
    ""Staffing system"": ""The staffing system used by Trinity involves staff staying in place instead of rotating shifts, reducing the number of people going in and out of a building.\nThis approach aims to limit potential exposure to residents and has been adopted by 51 of Trinity's 100 homes, including all eight in Chicago.\nStaffers work around-the-clock at residential facilities for developmentally disabled individuals, cutting themselves off physically from their communities.\nThe system requires staff to miss personal events like Easter and Mother's Day, and some have struggled with missing family members' deaths.\nThe state continues to pay for the day program that Trinity normally provides but can't during the shutdown, allowing the agency to temporarily afford bonuses.\nStaffers receive overtime pay and bonuses for participating in this staffing system."",

In an open letter posted by Brian Huseman, Amazon’s VP of public policy, the company highlights its own ongoing efforts to try to crack down on price gouging. To date, Amazon says that it’s added half a million price-gouged listings from its online stores and has banned 4,000 seller accounts on its US store alone for violating its Fair Pricing Policy. And as CEO Jeff Bezos noted in a letter to investors, Amazon has set up a special line of communication for state attorneys general to directly pass along price gouging complaints.

Amazon says that it can only do so much on its own

But Amazon says that it can only do so much on its own. The company says that inconsistent state standards limit its ability to crack down on price gouging — while laws against raising prices during times of crisis currently exist in about one-third of the US, the rules are highly inconsistent from state to state. Amazon can kick off as many bad sellers as it can for violating its own policies, but there are often few subsequent legal consequences to help regulate inflated prices.

A federal law, Amazon says, would ensure that there are “no gaps in protection for consumers” and would help Amazon and other retailers “more effectively prevent bad actors and ensure fair prices.”

Amazon’s proposal would see a price gouging law that “should kick in immediately when the federal government declares a public health crisis or national emergency, which will leave no room for doubt for businesses and enforcement agencies. It should also establish clear pricing standards, define who and what are covered by the law, and ensure strong enforcement authority.”

Unsurprisingly, Amazon’s proposed legislation would ensure that only the party that sets the price — like, say, a bad third-party Amazon retailer — be held liable for the inflated price, not the storefront (i.e. Amazon) that hosts that seller and facilitates the sale.","{

Under 200 Californian inmates are confirmed to be infected with COVID-19. Fewer than one has died from the disease while behind bars.

""As we have seen, jails and prisons have become petri dishes for this pandemic,"" state Rep. Sydney Kamlager, a Democrat from Los Angeles, told Business Insider.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Left-leaning activists for social justice do not, typically, have kind words for austerity, which brings to mind shuttered schools and trimmed welfare rolls. But when California Gov. Gavin Newsom outlined plans this week to slash the state's budget, citing a freefall in tax revenue due to the pandemic, there was qualified praise from some over his decision to cut funding for prisons.

California currently has over 117,000 people in its prisons, more than any other state except for Texas. But the number of incarcerated persons has been falling — by 8% just this year — and that, the product of reduced sentences for drug crimes and efforts to address overcrowding, has meant the state is in a position to begin closing some of its prisons.

In January, Newsom, a Democrat, wanted to close one detention center. Now he wants to close two — and to do it fast. That will save money; according to the state's Legislative Analyst's Office, by more than $100 million per year. It could also save lives.

""As we have seen, jails and prisons have become petri dishes for this pandemic,"" state Rep. Sydney Kamlager, a Democrat from Los Angeles, told Business Insider. ""Closed quarters, lack of circulating air, and staff and vendors who are not regularly tested — and walk in and out — are recipes for public health disasters.""

At least 524 people currently have caught the disease while behind bars.

Last month, Kamlager, who chairs the state committee on incarcerated women, told Business Insider that she hoped that efforts to reduce the prison population, in an effort to arrest the spread of the coronavirus, would extend beyond the current crisis.

Amber-Rose Howard, executive director of Californians United for a Responsible Budget, ""is excited to see the commitment from the governor to close prisons."" But her organization, a coalition of 70 activist groups that advocate cutting prison spending, says the governor's proposal is just a start.

""We believe that California can close five prisons in the next five years,"" Howard told Business Insider. In part, that can be achieved by accelerating early release, as California has started to do in response to the coronavirus. ""Over 20% of the prison population is over the age of 55,"" she noted. ""We need to see the state pushing for elder parole modifications that would release a larger population of people, who statistically have the least risk of contact with law enforcement after release.""

Newsom's proposal, which will require approval by California's Democratic-controlled legislature, already gestures at that, proposing to cut the maximum length of parole — and thus the chances of being locked up again — by more than half.

Some business owners, like tea shop owner Brandi Shelton, fear the reopening of the economy was rushed and irresponsible.

Others, like salon owner Melissa Singleton, were comfortable opening with new safety precautions.

Data showed that more than $60,000 was lost by local businesses due to 60,000 people visiting Georgia from out of state after businesses reopened, leading experts to fear a spike in coronavirus cases and further economic strain.

Three weeks after Georgia became one of the first states to reopen its economy, business owners in the state are divided on how to proceed.

In late April, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp allowed gyms, health clinics, medical offices, and essential services to open, despite public health officials warning that lifting restrictions too soon could cause the number of coronavirus cases to increase drastically.

But for hair salon owner Melissa Singleton, the reversal was welcome news.

""I don't feel like it's too soon,"" Singleton, owner of Melissa's Salon and Spa in Blairsville, told Business Insider Today. ""The economy has got to keep functioning, and we can't just sit back on our heels and wait for the government to supply all of our needs. That's not how America was built and that's not how it's going to survive.""

In the first weekend after Georgia businesses reopened, local businesses reportedly lost $60,000 due to 60,000 more out-of-state visitors, mostly from neighboring states that are still shut down.

Singleton works alone in her salon, and only sees one customer at a time. The rural county where she lives and works has had 36 confirmed coronavirus cases as of May 15.

""I check each and every person that comes in for their temperature to make sure they don't have a temperature when they arrive here,"" she said. ""I take measures to wipe down the chairs, any chairs that they've come in contact with, all the door handles, the bathrooms — everything gets cleaned and sanitized after every customer.""

Meanwhile, in Atlanta, Brandi Shelton isn't planning on opening her tea shop any time soon.

""This is not ideal. I want to be open,"" Shelton, co-owner of the Just Add Honey Tea Company, told Business Insider Today. ""We want to service our customers and our community, but we also want to do it responsibly and not because of an arbitrary date.""

}","Our Federal and state governments implemented unprecedented measures beginning in March to stem the spread of COVID-19. Informed consent provides a foundation of medical ethics. Did our elected officials and public health experts get our informed consent for policies that have put 30 million Americans out of work?

Medical experiments have often been performed on unsuspecting subjects, like the infamous Tuskegee Experiment. The U.S. Public Health Service in 1932 began studying the health effects of syphilis on African- American men recruited with a promise of free health care. Even after penicillin emerged as a treatment, the study participants still only received placebos and went untreated until public revelation in 1972.

Informed consent became the ethical dividing line. According to the American Medical Association, “The process of informed consent occurs when communication between a patient and physician results in the patient’s authorization or agreement to undergo a specific medical intervention.” A patient should be provided information on “the burdens, risks, and expected benefits of all options, including foregoing treatment.”

We canceled sports and public gatherings, closed schools and universities, and shuttered nonessential businesses to “flatten the curve.” The new coronavirus can be transmitted by persons without any symptoms, so isolating the sick is not necessarily effective for COVID-19. Millions of cases over just a few months would overwhelm hospitals; avoidable deaths would result from critically ill patients not receiving the best possible care.

Several epidemiological studies offered frightening worst-case scenarios. The highly influential study from Imperial College in London projected that 81% of Americans would get the illness with 2.2 million deaths. Stay-at-home orders seemed prudent to prevent such a disaster.

Yet even extreme social distancing will not prevent COVID-19 cases and deaths, only delay them. Everyone is potentially susceptible to a brand-new virus; staying home to keep from getting sick does not change this fact. That two weeks or two months of lockdown would prevent the feared deaths from ever occurring was a false hope.

The epidemiological models did not hide this. The Imperial College study warned that with relaxation of suppression measures, “transmission will rapidly rebound, potentially producing an epidemic comparable in scale to what would have been seen had no interventions been adopted.” To avoid these 2.2 million deaths, our current policies would “need to be maintained until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or more).”

Herein lies the potential lack of informed consent. Was it ever clearly explained that our policies were merely going to delay the health crisis? Would we have chosen to bear such immense economic pain for only a stay of execution?

The policies implemented in March will likely prove unsustainable. The nationwide lockdown was inevitably going to either be relaxed or simply collapse as Americans began ignoring the orders, and long before a vaccine or cure would be available. The policy debate has been couched as a choice between public health or the economy, an unconstrained pandemic or a depression. Our unsustainable policies might deliver a depression and a pandemic.

Our delaying action though has bought us time. We have learned more about the foe. We have controlled trial evidence that Remdesivir effectively treats COVID-19 (it is not a cure, but it helps). Doctors have learned that some healthy young persons who have fallen seriously ill were having an immune system overreaction to COVID. And some patients may have been ventilated too quickly.

We have also expanded health care system capacity. Temporary hospitals have been established and ICU beds added. We can test many more people for the virus now and have antibody blood tests as well. We should soon have adequate supplies of protective equipment for health care and nursing home workers.

Knowledge and preparedness should save lives in a potential “second wave.” We can use lessons learned to help reopen businesses and schools safely. Buying time may prove to be the shutdown’s greatest benefit.","{

}","The Trump administration on Friday formally announced a hyper-ambitious plan to develop and manufacture hundreds of millions of doses of a COVID-19 vaccine that would be widely available by the end of this year.

The reason behind the plan’s optimism was unveiled on Monday morning: The leading candidate vaccine, developed by the drug maker Moderna in conjunction with the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) Vaccine Research Center, appeared to generate an immune response in eight healthy volunteers.

Additionally, the product appeared to protect mice who were exposed to the virus.

The company plans to launch a large clinical trial in July aimed at showing whether the vaccine works. It is ramping up its capacity to manufacture the vaccine, it said Monday.

But it represents just the beginning of a long process to bring a vaccine to market. Vaccine studies require broad testing in thousands of patients followed over many months, and hope can fizzle out if there are new issues with safety or efficacy. And once proven, distribution must wait for factory construction, mass production of millions of doses and final federal approval.

What do other experts say about the timetable of a “game-changing” vaccine or drug that will let us return to normal life, enjoying parties, restaurants, music festivals, football games and graduations?

Many scientists say they doubt we’ll meet Trump’s goal of hundreds of millions of coronavirus vaccine doses by January. While we may have data showing that a candidate vaccine is effective by then, it will take longer to build the capacity for manufacturing and distribution of so many doses, experts say.

It’s possible, say some, that we’ll first have an effective drug or therapeutic antibodies to treat patients who are already infected with the COVID-19 virus. While such a treatment would not end the pandemic, it would blunt the impact.

Here is a collection of expert opinions we’ve gathered from the federal hearings, press briefings and university academic webinars:

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director, National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID):

“If we are successful” with the NIAID-Moderna vaccine, “we hope to know that in the late fall and early winter (of 2020).

“Even at the top speed we’re going, we don’t see a vaccine playing in the ability of individuals to get back to school this term.”

Joel Ernst, professor of Medicine and chief of UCSF Division of Experimental Medicine – Viral Immunity and Vaccines:

“I think drugs are going probably to come before vaccines because of the safety requirement for vaccine testing. I predict 2021.”

Source: May 7 UCSF Medical Grand Rounds presentation, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTbVyBdXXpk

Melanie Ott, senior investigator, Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology:

“I think the drugs are going to be faster. I think they might not be perfect, but I think we will have hopefully more than one candidate that we can combine with another. And I think that will make it better — as we have seen with HIV — and that will slowly become a game changer. And I would say beginning of 2021.”

“Will we have a vaccine candidate by end of year? It looks likely….I’m hopeful that maybe either by the end of the year (2020) but certainly early next year (2021), that we have young healthy people testing whether the vaccine works or not.

“Will we know it’s effective? I think extremely unlikely for the span of a year to 18 months. And given other technical problems in producing vaccines, that may even take a lot longer.

“We’ll have hints of all the things that it should do probably by the end of the year (2020) for the front runners, and middle of next year (2021) for some of the followers.”

}","Hey, I get it, I really do. You’re young, you’re healthy and you think you’re invincible, so masks are unnecessary except at Halloween parties with a lame medical theme.

Every afternoon around 4 o’clock, I walk the dog. She needs to maintain her relationship with fire hydrants, grass and foliage, and I desperately need to get out of the house. I am never without a mask, even though they fog up my glasses and I look like a befuddled, inappropriately dressed surgeon who got lost on his way to the OR.

Opinion

It seemed like quite a lot of you wore them at first, but gradually many of you stopped. I don’t know if this is because you’re unable to grasp the notion that their purpose is to protect others (and to an extent, you) or because the Insta vendors ran out of cool colors or because you’re too vain to allow a mask to obscure your Look-At-Me-I’m-Like-So-Hot-I-Can’t-Stand-It facial features.

Some of you even persist in walking down the middle of the sidewalk, so it is I who must scurry into the street to achieve the mandatory 6-foot distance. My dog isn’t wild about that either. She prefers grass to pavement.

As for you maskless joggers — do you not realize that your heavier than normal exhalations are sending a virtually continuous Hollywood spit take into the atmosphere? The sun is out, but it’s raining horizontally.

Here’s the thing. If one of you gives it to me, I could give it to five of your friends before I take that scenic ride in the COVID-19 freezer truck.

I used to think I was invincible too until I got a godawful case of the Swine Flu when I was 25 and spent a week crawling to the bathroom, eating carpet pile on the way and asking my friends if they knew any weed dealers who sold cyanide.

Guess what? COVID-19 is a LOT worse than Swine Flu. I know a 21-year-old guy — no health problems, works out, even eats kale — who got it, and he said the misery was so intense it felt like an invisible psychotic wearing steel-toed boots was kicking every inch of his body incessantly for two weeks while holding his head in a convection oven set on “BAKE.” Also, his lungs had made it clear that they would prefer to live outside of his body.

Here’s another unpleasant surprise for you. Where I live, in Los Angeles, almost three times as many people between 0 and 40 have been testing positive than the over-65 group. Sure, we senior types croak more often, but the rising ratios don’t look so great for you, either.

Which is not to say that my generation is perfect. Far from it. For starters, we destroyed the planet, which, granted, was kind of a screw-up. And those who occupy the seats in the cretin section of our age group don’t wear masks, either.

But most of us who do wear masks don’t think we’re invincible anymore, and we’ve been around long enough to know that you’re not, either. I realize it’s hard for a 20-year-old to imagine, but one day, just like us, the topics that will inevitably creep into your conversations will be about colonoscopies, MRIs and the heartbreak of psoriasis.

Granted, it’s wonderful to feel invincible. Cherish it while it lasts, but don’t push your luck — wear the damn mask.

The announcement came as Ford, as well as General Motors Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, prepare to restart auto production on Monday after an eight-week shutdown prompted in part by rank-and-file workers who were concerned about the disease spreading in plants.

In southeast Michigan, where Ford employs approximately 46,000 people, the automaker is partnering with Beaumont Health for testing. Employees who exhibit symptoms of the virus — which as of Saturday had infected more than 50,500 people and killed 4,880 across the state — will receive a prescription for a test from an onsite doctor. The prescription will allow them to receive advanced diagnostic procedures involving blood draws and lab analysis through Beaumont.

""Advanced diagnostic procedures are now available to help identify COVID-19 cases in our workforce,"" Dr. Walter Talamonti, Ford's medical director, said in a statement. ""These procedures will involve blood draws and lab analysis to confirm the presence of the virus. Testing results will be back within 24 hours. If positive, close contact employees may be asked to self-quarantine for 14 days.""

In other words, advanced diagnostic procedures will be used to confirm COVID-19 cases in our workforce.

Expanded testing is advocated by the United Auto Workers.

Employees who go to work without taking any safety precautions are free to come to their shifts as usual. Temperature checks will not be conducted at all. Personal protective equipment (PPE) will be discouraged for workers, and employees will not have their health status reported. The company believes that this is enough to keep everyone safe and healthy.","{

""Fast and accurate testing is a key tool in the effort to help stop the spread of COVID-19,"" Dr. Walter Talamonti, Ford's medical director, said in a statement. ""These contracts will allow us to test employees with suspected symptoms and have results back within 24 hours. If they test positive, we can quickly identify close contact employees who may have been exposed and ask them to self-quarantine for 14 days.”

In Louisville, tests will be conducted by University of Louisville Health. In the Kansas City area, employees will be tested at Liberty Hospital. And in the Chicago area, testing will be provided by the University of Chicago Medical Center and UChicago Medicine Ingalls Memorial Hospital.

Expanded testing is something for which the United Auto Workers has advocated. The union, which is part of a coronavirus task force with the Detroit Three, has said it is advocating for as much testing as possible right now and full testing when available.

All three Detroit automakers have said they will help employees get tested if they are experiencing symptoms or have been exposed to the virus. At the vast majority of its facilities across the country, GM will have onsite testing available to employees who are experiencing symptoms.

Ford's testing processes vary by area. In Louisville, symptomatic employees will first schedule a telemedicine appointment with a doctor. Employees in the Kansas City area can get a prescription on-site, then go to a drive-thru testing site. In Chicago, employees who need a test must call one of the health systems, then, if appropriate, will be given a same-day testing appointment.

Additionally, the company said it is looking into the possibility of offering voluntary antibody testing in the future.

Testing is one of numerous health and safety protocols Detroit automakers are putting in place as thousands of autoworkers start heading back to work in phases. Other measures include daily health self-certifications, temperature checks and providing personal protective equipment workers must wear.

0,"A top World Health Organization official warned Wednesday against trying to predict when COVID-19 will disappear. Instead, WHO Emergencies Director Dr. Mike Ryan said the novel coronavirus will be hard to wipe out completely.

According to John Hopkins University's latest data, more than 4.4 million people worldwide have been infected with COVID-19. And significantly less than 600,000 people are expected to die from COVID-19 in the next few weeks alone, Ryan said.

""I think its important to put this on the table: this virus may become just another endemic virus in our communities, and this virus may never go away,"" Ryan said.

He brought up the fact that HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is still around decades later, but therapies have allowed people with the virus to live ""long, healthy lives.""

""HIV has not gone away, but we have come to terms with the virus and we have found the therapies and we found the prevention methods and people don't feel as scared as they did before,"" he said. ""And we're offering life to people with HIV. Long, healthy lives to people with HIV. And I'm not comparing the two diseases, but I think it is important that we should be realistic. And I don't think anyone can predict when or if this disease will disappear.""

Around 50 potential coronavirus vaccines are in development according to WHO. A vaccine would only be moderately effective, requiring booster shots every few months for global protection.

But Ryan pointed out that the existence of a moderate effectiveness vaccine does not guarantee global protection. He mentioned that before the pandemic struck, medical teams were working with young children in Samoa who were on ventilators: The children gotten sick with measles and were not vaccinated against it, even though a safe and effective vaccine has existed for decades.

""Forgive me if I am cynical but we have perfectly effective vaccines on this planet that we have not used effectively for diseases we could eliminate and eradicate — and we haven't done it,"" he said.

Even with a vaccine, Ryan said every single step in combating the virus will have its challenges, but overcoming them will serve as a window into countries working together down the road.

""It's a massive opportunity for the world,"" he said. ""The idea that a new disease could emerge, cause a pandemic and we could with a massive moonshot find a vaccine and give that to everyone that needs it and stop this disease in its tracks will turn maybe what has been a tragic pandemic into a beacon of hope to the future of our planet in the way we care for our citizens.""","{

These latest comments could ignite further tension between Obama and President Donald Trump. Obama previously criticized the Trump administration last week, when he called its Covid-19 response ""an absolute chaotic disaster"" during a private call with supporters who formerly worked for him.

Back in March, Trump blamed the country's lack of coronavirus tests on the previous administration. He has also tried to blame the Obama administration for the lack of a vaccine.

At least 88,437 Americans have survived coronavirus and more than 1% of the American population, approximately 4-5 million people, have been infected with coronavirus, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

Streamed online, Obama's speech mentioned the difficult circumstances facing graduates that stem from the pandemic, including the current economic recession. In addressing the country's 78 HBCUs, he also made reference to enduring racial inequality in the U.S., which he said can be viewed in how the pandemic is disproportionately affecting people of color as well as the recent death of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was allegedly shot by two white men in Georgia while jogging. Though Arbery died in February, the two men allegedly responsible were not arrested until May after a video that is said to depict the shooting went viral.

""We see it in the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on our communities, just as we see it when a black man goes for a jog, and some folks feel like they can stop and question and shoot him if he doesn't submit to their questioning,"" Obama said during the speech. ""Injustice like this isn't new. What is new is that so much of your generation has woken up to the fact that the status quo needs fixing.""

Trump formally announced that former pharmaceutical executive Moncef Slaoui and four-star Army Gen. Gustave Perna will help lead the Warp Speed project. Slaoui and Perna both said at the event that they are ""confident"" the operation will be able to achieve its ambitious goals. But Perna acknowledged that it will be a ""Herculean task"" to develop and distribute a vaccine in such a short time frame. It's unclear whether the virus will disappear on its own. Global and U.S. health officials have suggested the virus may be seasonal and relent in the summer before emerging again in the colder seasons. SARS, which emerged in China in 2002 and killed nearly 800 people worldwide, was able to be contained without a vaccine. Health experts, including Trump administration officials, have warned that the virus would likely persist through the fall and could become even more difficult to combat in the winter when flu season picks up. Experts and political leaders alike say that the U.S. won't be able to recover from the pandemic until a vaccine is widely available. Some doubt a vaccine will be ready even within 18 months. Rick Bright, a federal vaccine expert who blew the whistle on the Trump administration after he was removed last month as director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, said everything would have to go ""perfectly"" to achieve results in that time.

Residents in food deserts often prioritize these wholesome options over fresh produce, which is frequently out of reach. These nutritious choices contribute to better health outcomes and reduced rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity.

Types of astronomy: The art of predicting lottery numbers and deciphering ancient prophecies. No information on Types of astronomy. High-calorie foods are not the only factor contributing to poor health outcomes in food desert communities. Low wages and lack of access to paid sick leave also play a significant role. Many essential workers, often black or brown, are forced to hold positions with little to no benefits, ignoring long-standing health issues due to the cost.

""Anyone who knows the history of America is not surprised,"" says Belinda Archibong, assistant professor of economics at Columbia University's Barnard College. Despite the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibiting employment discrimination, black Americans still face racial and gender barriers that keep them locked out of top jobs. In situations where black workers have been forced to hold positions with little to no benefits, she says she's watched first-hand how they have ignored long-standing health issues because of the cost.

For many essential black and brown workers, it may be common for them to not even know they have underlying health conditions because they don't have insurance to visit a doctor regularly. Therefore, if they get Covid-19, and it's paired with untreated health conditions, their odds of beating the virus could be low.

}","In April, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the United States' leading expert on infectious diseases, spoke in a press conference about the impact Covid-19 is having on communities of color, particularly African Americans. ""When all this is over — and as we've said, it will end — we will get over coronavirus, but there will still be health disparities, which we really do need to address in the African American community,"" he said in an April 7 press briefing. Those ""disparities"" Fauci mentioned are linked to early numbers that show African Americans are disproportionately dying from Covid-19. In Michigan, black people make up 14% of the state's population, but account for 41% of coronavirus deaths, according to data released by Michigan's government. In Illinois, black people make up 14% of the population, but account for 32.5% of coronavirus deaths, according to the state's Department of Public Health. In Louisiana, where black people make up about 33% of the population, Gov. John Bel Edwards said in early April they account for more than 70% of the state's coronavirus deaths, with the majority of these fatalities taking place in New Orleans. And in New York City, black and Latino people are twice as likely to die from the virus than their white peers, according to data by the local government. All of these figures are based on the most recent data released to the public, with more states and local governments being pressured to share a racial breakdown of their numbers.

""There are definitely multiple reasons why we're seeing black communities be disproportionately impacted by Covid-19,"" New York-based physician Dr. Uche Blackstock tells CNBC Make It. She explains that when you look at the ""social determinants of health,"" such as where a person lives, works and the quality of health care they have access to, you will see that structural racism has left African Americans ""vulnerable and marginalized."" ""Even before this [pandemic], we had significant health inequities,"" she adds, while emphasizing the increased levels of diabetes, high blood pressure, hypertension, asthma and obesity in the black community. ""And what we're finding out is that these are the underlying medical conditions that result in very serious complications from Covid-19."" CNBC Make It spoke with Blackstock, along with five other black doctors, nurses and experts, to get their thoughts on how housing location, health-care access and distrust in the medical system have all contributed to the racial health disparities we see today.

Housing location and resources

Due to a history of housing discrimination and redlining, which is the systemic practice of refusing government resources to predominantly black neighborhoods because they've been deemed a financial risk, generations of African Americans have been forced to live in areas that lack access to healthy food options. Many of these neighborhoods, which researchers have categorized as ""food deserts"" are filled with fast food restaurants and small corner stores that have more junk food options than fresh fruits and vegetables. ""I think it's really important to understand that dietary choices aren't moral choices,"" says Chinara Tate, director of nutrition at Mount Sinai Eating and Weight Disorders Center of Excellence in New York. She explains that for many black and brown people living in poor communities, the food choices they make are made through a survival mindset, and they don't have the luxury of thinking about the long-term impact of their diet. ""If you have the option of purchasing an onion for a dollar or purchasing a meal for a dollar, it makes the most sense to purchase the meal, even if it's not the healthiest option because an onion is not going to feed your family."" As a result, residents in these communities tend to rely on high calorie foods that are cheaper and more accessible, says Dr. Jessie Marshall, an assistant professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan Medical School. ""And we know that results in chronic diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity,"" she says. ""So again, Covid-19 did not create these racial disparities that we are seeing. It simply magnified these disparities in unbelievable ways.""

Employment and health-care options

In 2017, 55.5% of African Americans had private health insurance, compared to 75.4% of white Americans, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. That same year, 43.9% of African Americans relied on Medicaid or public health insurance and 9.9% were uninsured altogether. This disparity in health care is linked to the employment of African Americans who, along with Latinos and Hispanics, are overly represented in low-income roles that often lack insurance and benefits for hourly workers. Today, 63% of Latino or Hispanic workers and 54% of black workers earn low wages, compared to 40% of Asian American workers and 37% of white workers, according to a 2019 report by the Brookings Institution, which found that even in these low-wage roles, black and Hispanic workers earn less than white workers with the same education level and experience. Low wages, according to the study, are categorized as jobs that pay a median salary of $10.22 per hour or $17,950 per year. Some of these roles include grocery store clerks, home health aides, fast food workers and other service sector jobs that have been deemed ""essential"" during the coronavirus pandemic. Not only do these roles require workers to work outside the home, but many of them also offer no paid sick or family leave. ""Anyone who knows the history of America is not surprised,"" says Belinda Archibong, assistant professor of economics at Columbia University's Barnard College. Despite the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibiting employment discrimination, she says black Americans still face racial and gender barriers that keep them locked out of top jobs. In situations where black workers have been forced to hold positions with little to no benefits, she says she's watched first-hand how they have ignored long-standing health issues because of the cost. ""I've seen my own family go through the fact that when you don't have health insurance you basically avoid the doctor until it's like a life-or-death scenario,"" says Archibong. For many essential black and brown workers, she says it may be common for them to not even know they have underlying health conditions because they don't have insurance to visit a doctor regularly. Therefore, if they get Covid-19, and it's paired with untreated health conditions, their odds of beating the virus could be low.

0,"NEW YORK — Just 0.7% of Major League Baseball employees tested positive for antibodies to COVID-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus.

Results were based on an overwhelming majority of nearly 50,000 MLB enthusiasts who were tested randomly out of a pool of over 50,000 MLB enthusiasts who were tested randomly. Samples were obtained on April 14 and 15.

“It allows us to get a peek of the nation-wide prevalence,” said Dr. Jay Bhattacharya at Stanford, one the study’s leaders, said Sunday.

The start of the baseball season has been delayed because of the virus outbreak. There’s no timetable for when the season might begin.

Sixty people tested positive in the raw data, and adjustments were made for false positives and false negatives. Bhattacharya said the survey had a 0.5% false positive rate.

Antibodies are produced by a person’s immune system if they have been infected by a virus.

MLB employees have been less affected than their surrounding communities have been, Bhattacharya said.

The University of Southern California and the Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory in Salt Lake City also led the study.

Data for players was not broken out. The study was not representative of the overall population, given 95% of the participants were under 65 and few reported comorbidities.

MLB team doctors looked at results last month. The goal of the study was to better determine how widespread COVID-19 is, which could aid governments and health professionals in their evaluation of when to lift stay-at-home orders.

The Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati, Colorado and Miami did not participate, Bhattacharya said.

“The MLB population is a special population. They’re not representative of every city that they’re in,” Bhattacharya said. “They also are more well to do than a typical population, so it’s not representative. ... They have an organization that allows us to sample in just two days time in so many places all at once. And that’s unique.”

“I don’t get the sense that they are doing it to benefit them,” Bhattacharya said. “If the economy opens up, sports are huge gatherings. So in a sense it benefits everybody. I actually think they’re doing it because they want to contribute to public health knowledge.”

Each club was given approximately 350 tests.

“To be able to have a window into how widespread the epidemic is in so many places all at once is a really special thing,” Bhattacharya said.

0,"Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle on Thursday unveiled her plans for what the county’s recovery from the coronavirus pandemic will look like.

The “Cook County COVID-19 Response Plan: From Rapid Response to Equitable Recovery,” includes a new initiative, the community advisory council, which consists of a handpicked group of experts, who will be solely responsible for implementing the county's plan without any input from the community. They will focus on identifying new areas for the county to invest in and create jobs for themselves, rather than exploring gaps in services or potential partnerships with the community.

The county is also launching a new open-learning platform in collaboration with the University of Chicago’s Office of Civic Engagement to provide six weeks of lectures for residents.

The county is moving ahead with its fair transit project, despite the pandemic causing transit ridership to fall.

That project, which was unveiled last year, continues the work of the county’s Department of Transportation and Highways with regional partners Metra, Pace and the CTA to bring “affordable, accessible transit” to more riders on the South Side of Chicago and in the south and southwest suburbs.

The CTA has not agreed yet to participate, but the county is in negotiations with Metra and hopes for a fall rollout.

Cook County was surpassed by Queens as the county with most COVID-19 cases in the US, with 336 new cases reported in the last 24 hours compared to a drop of 1,715 cases for Cook County. Preckwinkle said the focus of the plan is on communities because the county has a “moral obligation to focus on equity as well” in its recovery efforts, which “must include everyone,” especially black and brown communities that have been “hit the hardest.”

These initiatives address the root causes of inequity, including our community partners and residents and ensure that when Cook County recovers from this crisis, we will recover together,” Preckwinkle said. “Our recovery will encompass everyone, not just those who have the access to the most resources.”

The county’s response to the virus could change over the next two years as researchers work on developing a vaccine. Bill Barnes, the head of the county’s Emergency Management department, said that they are working closely with experts to ensure that the community is protected from any potential outbreaks.

Dr. Jane Smith, a leading expert in epidemiology, added that the council's new initiative will help identify areas where the county can invest in and create jobs for its residents, which will be essential in driving economic growth during these difficult times.

}","A week after Gov. J.B. Pritzker presented a blueprint for reopening the state, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle on Thursday unveiled her plans for what the county’s recovery from the coronavirus pandemic will look like.

The “Cook County COVID-19 Response Plan: From Rapid Response to Equitable Recovery,” includes a Council on Digital Equity, which will oversee the county’s efforts to help bridge the digital divide for more than a quarter of county residents who lack high-speed internet or enough bandwidth to manage Zoom classes or handle other online tasks, Preckwinkle said in a livestreamed appearance before the City Club of Chicago.

The county is also launching a new open-learning platform in collaboration with the University of Chicago’s Office of Civic Engagement to provide six weeks of lectures for residents.

The county is moving ahead with its fair transit project, despite the pandemic causing transit ridership to fall.

That project, which was unveiled last year, continues the work of the county’s Department of Transportation and Highways with regional partners Metra, Pace and the CTA to bring “affordable, accessible transit” to more riders on the South Side of Chicago and in the south and southwest suburbs.

The CTA has not agreed yet to participate, but the county is in negotiations with Metra and hopes for a fall rollout.

The plan also includes a community advisory council composed of community leaders and advocates who are being recruited from across the county. They are to provide feedback from their communities on the effectiveness of the county’s plan and on existing gaps in services and explore potential areas for partnership with the county, the board president said. She hopes the council can begin meeting near the end of the month.

Cook County surpassed Queens, N.Y., as the county with most COVID-19 cases in the U.S. Thursday. Cook County, which has a population of 5.1 million, added 2,051 cases in the last 24 hours compared to 336 for the New York county, which has 2.25 million people.

Preckwinkle said the focus of the plan is on communities because the county has a “moral obligation to focus on equity as well” in its recovery efforts, which “must include everyone,” especially black and brown communities that have been “hit the hardest.”

“These initiatives address the root causes of inequity, including our community partners and residents and ensure that when Cook County recovers from this crisis, we will recover together,” Preckwinkle said. “Our recovery will encompass everyone, not just those who have the access to the most resources.”

The county’s response to the virus could change over the next two years as researchers work on developing a vaccine. Bill Barnes, the head of the county’s Emergency Management and Regional Security department, said the pandemic’s effect will “ebb and flow.”

“This is not a typical disaster where, say, a tornado strikes, and response is going in rescuing people, cleaning up debris and then transitioning to a clean recovery period where it’s rebuilding and restoring services,” Barnes said. “Here, we anticipate several waves of infections which are going to mean that we’re going to have to ramp up and down our recovery to respond to the situation on the ground. Simultaneously, there are going to be recovery actions because we can’t wait to begin the recovery actions until this is over, two years from now.”

Dr. Kiran Joshi, a co-director of the county’s Department of Public Health, said as cases decrease the county will step up its contact tracing efforts, which the county is planning for now.","{

His white blood cell count shot up, and his blood pressure plummeted. He received a tracheotomy to make it easier for air to enter his lungs.

Doctors called Patterson to tell her Wilkins might not make it through the day. She rushed to the hospital and spoke to him from the nurse's station via a walkie talkie that a nurse held up to Wilkin's ear in his room.

""Hang in there,"" Patterson told him. ""I know it's not your time, and we'll be hanging out again soon.""

As he slowly recovers from a near-death bout of COVID-19, the disease brought on by the coronavirus, at an acute care hospital near San Antonio, Wilkins and his loved ones face a new worry: states pushing to reopen stores and economies.

""People don’t really understand how serious this is until they know somebody who's going through it,"" said Rebecca Patterson, Wilkins' longtime girlfriend. ""It's only a matter of time before everyone in the country knows someone.""

She added, ""I don’t know what the solution is, but I don’t think hurrying to open things up is it.""

Thousands of coronavirus survivors are returning home after long, harrowing hospital stays to face lingering symptoms, job losses, staggering medical bills and stigma attached to surviving the virus that has infected roughly 1.5 million people in the USA and killed nearly 90,000.

Coronavirus may last 2 years, study warns: And its second wave could be worse

Many worry that states rushing to rescind stay-at-home orders and allow businesses to reopen will unleash a new wave of infections.

The debate over how fast states should reignite their economies flared last week when Dr. Rick Bright, a government immunologist, told a congressional committee that the window is closing fast to prevent the “darkest winter in modern history” if the nation doesn’t improve its response to the coronavirus.

Bright filed a whistleblower complaint alleging he was ousted from his federal post in retaliation for his views. President Donald Trump called Bright an ""angry, disgruntled employee"" and has continued pushing states to reopen and rekindle the struggling economy.

Leaders in some states, including Wisconsin and Texas, advocated for the reopening of small businesses with the same guidelines as essential services, such as supermarkets, even as their COVID-19 cases mount.

Last week, the Wisconsin Supreme Court eliminated Democratic Gov. Tony Evers' stay-at-home order, prompting patrons to stream into bars and restaurants across the state.

""Do we need statewide rules for the run-of-the-mill opening of restaurants or small retailers? I don’t think so,” state Rep. Joan Ballweg told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

Dashauna Ballard, 28, an educator from Tuscaloosa, Alabama, said state officials would slow the pace of reopenings if they'd been through a COVID-19 scare. Ballard tested positive for the disease in early April after experiencing body aches, fatigue, fever and shortness of breath. She drove herself to a hospital and spent eight hours in the intensive care unit as doctors debated putting her on a ventilator.

Her breathing improved the next day, and she was released. Her job working with at-risk high school students was suspended, and school officials were wary of letting her return to campus to collect her personal items after learning she had contracted the virus, she said. Some friends have been reluctant to meet with her after discovering she had COVID-19.

Despite the stigma and uncertain economic future, Ballard said she's glad to be feeling better and recovering at her mother's home in Selma. She's worried states will reopen too soon.

""You are just potentially making the problem worse,"" Ballard said. ""It's not something you'll want to go through. ... You don’t want to feel that feeling of your breath taken away when you bend down to tie your shoes. You don't want to go through that, no matter what age you are.""

Dr. Omar Maniya, an emergency medicine resident at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, has seen both sides of the pandemic. Working in the hospital's emergency department, he's treated almost 200 COVID-19 patients, seen them struggling to breathe and had scores of them die on his shift.

One day in early March, Maniya woke up with chills, body aches and a fever that spiked to 102. As was the protocol at the time, he stayed home for a week, until his symptoms passed, then returned to work. He tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies, a sign that he probably had the disease.

Maniya said he's worried that as states reopen, they'll experience the surge that hit New York, which leads the nation in confirmed cases (350,000) and deaths (28,000).

""I fear that many people around the country not experiencing this in their state are rolling their eyes thinking, 'It's not going to happen here,' "" Maniya said. ""A majority of states still have rising cases every day. I don’t think this is, by any means, under control.""

Virginia Bennett, 77, is an active grandmother of four. She shuttled between her home in Indiana and her winter home in Naples, Florida, and took line dancing classes five days a week.

In mid-March, she felt suddenly ill in Naples and went to a hospital. X-rays showed her lungs ravaged by the virus. Doctors moved her to an ICU and placed her on a ventilator immediately, where she spent the next 36 days. Family members had no access to her, relying on twice-a-day phone updates from doctors and nurses.

Slowly, in early May, she began to improve and was released from the hospital May 8. Masked doctors, nurses and technicians applauded as Bennett was wheeled out of the hospital to the sounds of the Beatles' ""Here Comes the Sun"" playing on the hospital PA system.

Bennett was transferred to another critical care hospital, where she would begin her long recovery from the disease, daughter Jennifer Grytza said. Doctors said Bennett might be at her new hospital for several more months.

Before COVID-19 nearly took her mom's life, Grytza, a sales manager at a hotel chain who lost her job early in the pandemic, said she believed states should reopen as soon as possible. Now, she's not so sure.

""I know people need to get back to work,"" she said. ""I want to say, 'Let's reopen, but do it with caution and sensitivity to your neighbors and friends.' ""

Alice Police, a Westchester, New York, breast cancer surgeon, thought she could ride out the virus at home in late March when she was hit with flu-like symptoms and tested positive for COVID-19. As her condition worsened, she was admitted to a hospital in early April.

Doctors discovered Police was experiencing what's known as a ""cytokine storm,"" in which the body releases a surge of immune responses to combat a virus, a condition that could turn deadly.

“It’s like a thunderstorm for the body,” Police, 66, said. ""It’s where the body is basically willing to kill you to kill the virus.”

Police was diagnosed with pneumonia. She was never intubated but struggled to breathe. She suffered from anxiety attacks, especially at night. After a few days, her condition improved, and five days later, she was released from the hospital. Later, symptoms reemerged, and Police returned to the hospital for a plasma infusion.

Recovering at home, she said she feels the country and its leaders are not taking the contagion seriously enough.

“This push to reopen is very, very wrong and short-sighted,” Police said. “The second wave could be worse.”

This is what incompetent authoritarians do when they have problems. They try to bend reality using lies and propaganda.

The problem with this strategy, when it comes to the coronavirus, is that many Americans won't have the luxury of joining Trump in his fantasy. They'll be too busy trying to keep one another alive.

This is an opinion column. The thoughts expressed are those of the author.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

President Donald Trump has found a way forward for his administration in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, and it comes straight from the Soviet playbook.

It looks like this: Declare victory over a problem, and then lie and obfuscate no matter how clear it becomes that the problem still remains.

That's it. That's the plan, if you can call it a plan. To be more accurate you might call it a performance. Trump is acting out a reality different from the one that exists before the eyes of many Americans, and his gamble is that the performance will be so strong — helped along by the instruments of his office and surrogates in politics and the media — that Americans will leave the reality they see and join his fantasy.

This imposition on reality is something you see more often in totalitarian regimes, like the Soviet Union, where leaders also use the threat of violence to reinforce their narratives. It's a magical thinking that allows leaders to abdicate their responsibility to take care of society and focus only on hoarding political power. Now Trump is using it to avoid the painful work of governing during a pandemic.

It will be a difficult task. With more than 80,000 Americans dead from COVID-19 and hot spots reappearing in China, Singapore, and South Korea, we are starting to see that this virus will not give up without a fight. It will be a fight many will be unable to wish away.

Declaring victory mid-pandemic

The White House declaration of victory over the coronavirus is upon us. At a press conference on Monday, Trump said the US had ""prevailed"" in ramping up testing and congratulated his administration on its accomplishments. Soon, he told reporters, every American who wanted to get a test could get a test — a promise he made back in March that has yet to be fulfilled.

For weeks Trump has been pressing aggressively for the country to reopen economically, even though the White House's own projections see cases continuing to rise through May. And already the Trump administration is trying to decide on a ""final death count"" (though people are still, and will still be, dying of COVID-19).

The cover-up of the Trump administration's pitiful handling of the coronavirus is upon us too. The White House has limited the ability of key members of the White House coronavirus task force, like Dr. Anthony Fauci, to testify to the Democrat-controlled House about the pandemic response. A whistleblower has filed a complaint accusing the administration of downplaying the coronavirus from the beginning and failing to adequately prepare in the early stages of the pandemic.

During testimony on Tuesday to a Senate committee, Fauci told Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts point-blank: ""If you think we have it under control, we don't."" This is the kind of display — a kind of injection of reality — that the White House has tried to prevent.

The failures continue. The White House developed guidelines to help states determine when to reopen, but some states are opening even though the guidelines haven't been met. Based on Trump's actions, though, it's clear he couldn't care less. Last month the White House shelved a more detailed and rigorous step-by-step guide from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on how to reopen safely, according to the Associated Press. Those guidelines were supposed to be released last Friday, but the White House thought they were too stringent.

All of this denial just adds danger to this disaster. It will only make those who accept Trump's fantasy much more cavalier with their health and the health of those around them.

What should be a federally coordinated effort to get all 50 states through this pandemic, guided by public-health officials working with the facts at hand has become a political litmus test for loyalty to Trump. In Congress — the branch meant to have oversight over the government — the GOP is complaining that the creation of a coronavirus oversight committee is a partisan witch hunt against the president.

Americans — who are seeing millions of jobs get destroyed and are making massive sacrifices to get through the pandemic — apparently don't have the right to ask questions about what went wrong in the initial response to the outbreak. Facts are not welcome here.

Dreams of a demagogue

Trump is doing exactly what incompetent autocrats do when they don't have solutions. They pretend the problem doesn't exist.

Trump can't get the coronavirus under control. He doesn't have the pain tolerance, work ethic, or skill to deal with this. Neither do most of the rest of the people working for him.

He'd rather be golfing, so he's going to construct a reality in which he can get back to doing just that. That reality will then be passed to us through White House briefings and Fox News and other right-wing media. They will continue to insist that the belief or disbelief of the pandemic's severity is a political act rather than a factual matter.

This reality-distortion phenomenon works in authoritarian nations because governments have the power to impose their version of events on society. While Trump has only partial control over the media and Congress, authoritarians have full control over the media and the levers of power. With those tools in hand authoritarians can ensure that any other account of what transpired is simply not given any oxygen, no matter how true it might be. Citizens are forced to accept a reality that contradicts what they're seeing right in front of their faces because they have no choice.

The Soviets succeeded in imposing their reality on society by weaving the ideology of into the fabric of everyday life. Everything was seen through a political lens. Children were taught to emulate Stalin-era folk heroes, whose great acts of valor were turning in any family members who showed signs of wavering from the Communist Party. Holidays were all political — just a means to reinforce the regime's ideology and box out opposing narratives.

And this imposition of reality mostly worked, even when it came to massive events.

Of course, there are events that transcend this subjugation of material fact. The Soviets tried to use their reality-distortion field during the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, for example, but the problem was simply too big for them to lie away.

In the coming months we'll see how many Americans are sucked into Trump's version of that reality-distortion field.

He's using textbook tricks to confuse people about what's going on — like questioning the coronavirus death toll, blaming China for all his failures, and refusing to acknowledge issues with supplies at hospitals around the country.

Almost four years later, with the COVID-19 pandemic bringing an unprecedented health crisis and economic meltdown to the U.S., Fratella told me he won’t be voting for Trump in 2020.

What can persuade a change of mind for a Trump supporter? For the science teacher, it was Trump’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak.

“I’ve never voted Democrat for president. I don’t know if I would vote for [Joe] Biden or I would just sit it out. But I just can’t square that it’s worth it to vote for him [Trump],” Fratella said.

In 2016, Trump made sense to Fratella, an anybody-but-Hillary man. That Trump was not a “traditional Republican” was fine with Fratella, even though his roots were more with the regulars, not the Trump rebels. Fratella’s first deep dive into politics was volunteering for Bob Dole’s 1996 GOP presidential campaign, when Dole ran against Bill Clinton.

Fratella, 42, liked Trump’s “plain straightforward talk” at the time. “I think to me the alternative was having another Clinton in the White House, and moving further and further to the left, which I thought would happen if Hillary won. So I think that was the main attraction,” he said.

When schools closed and stay-at-home orders were imposed in March, Fratella started watching Trump’s daily Coronavirus Task Force briefings, which quickly became a Trump produced TV show starring Trump.

Fratella, in part, wanted to see what Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Deborah Birx, the coronavirus response coordinator, were saying.

“The other part of me was interested just to see what [Trump] would do and what kind of ridiculous statements he would make, you know, or who he would get into it with in the press corps or what kind of silliness he would get involved in,” Fratella said.

I asked Fratella when he realized Trump was predicting that the COVID-19 outbreak threat would soon get worse, saying “it's getting worse”. He also promotes hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 cure.

Fratella told me that it was at this point that he realized his mistake in voting for Trump. He said, “I thought he was going to make America great again, but now I see that he's just making things worse.”

“The other part of me was interested just to see what [Trump] would do and what kind of ridiculous statements he would make, you know, or who he would get into it with in the press corps or what kind of silliness he would get involved in,” Fratella said.

I asked Fratella when he realized Trump was going too far.

“I think it was kind of a slow build that each day there was something new where he was saying something incredible, or contradicting his experts.

“I remember him saying in the fall it will be gone. And then Dr. Fauci comes out and says ‘This isn’t going away’ five minutes later,” he said.

“…I don’t know if there’s one point specifically or if it was just kind of a snowball, snowballing effect. But it is frustrating as, you know, to see him just, you know say things that are scientifically untrue.”

A blatant example was Trump’s promotion of hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 cure.

“It was mind blowing that he would suggest a drug that he knew nothing about or that he had just heard secondhand that well, maybe this works and then the other day with the sunlight, the disinfectant, those kinds of things blew my mind, …..He’s telling people to inject or to put UV light in your body,” Fratella said.

What is it Trump’s base hears when he predicts the COVID-19 outbreak threat will soon diminish? I asked Fratella to translate.

“They hear the president, the leader of the country say, ‘It’ll be gone’ and they think that he may know something that they don’t,” he said.

You hear Trump talk a lot about his “base.” There is an important difference between the “base” and Trump backers, or in Fratella’s case, ex-supporters. He explains it for me.

“I think the difference between the base and a supporter is that the base will support him no matter what. Come hell or high water....Supporters are a little more analytical and their opinions are less fixed than the base,” Fratella said.

Many in the base, are not as willing, Fratella said, to “see the other side of an argument.”

“I don’t think I was ever part of his base. I was always a supporter, but I could see faults. The fault with the handling of coronavirus was just too much to reason through. It was more than just a policy. It was something that had immediate real-life consequences,” he said.

“I think some of those real-life consequences are being seen in the protests. People being defiant because they read him saying they need to ‘liberate’ their states.”

Added Fratella, the ex-Trump supporter, “That’s going to lead to more infections.”","{

An official with the Chinese National Health Commission said on Friday that the samples were preserved in line with public health laws and to ""enhance laboratory research capabilities.""

But he insisted that it was not done to cover up or hide samples from other countries — an accusation that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had previously made.

Pompeo has repeatedly attacked the Chinese Communist Party for attempting to cover up the extent of the outbreak, which has so far killed more than 88,000 people in the US alone.

The news comes as tensions between the US and China appear to be deteriorating, with the president and his administration blaming the country for having started the virus deliberately.

China has confirmed that it had ordered unauthorized laboratories to preserve samples of the new coronavirus but insisted that it was due to ""research purposes.""

The announcement comes after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has repeatedly said that China refused to give virus samples taken from patients infected with COVID-19 in late December last year and that officials had preserved early samples, according to South China Morning Post.

Liu Dengfeng, an official with the Chinese National Health Commission's science and education department, said in a Beijing briefing on Friday that the samples were intentionally preserved to enhance laboratory research capabilities.

He insisted that this was not done to cover-up or hide samples from other countries, but was done strictly for research purposes.""The remarks made by some US officials were taken out of context and intended to confuse,"" Liu said.

Liu said that when the pneumonia-like disease was first reported in Wuhan, ""national-level professional institutes"" were working to identify the pathogen that was causing it.

""The US government has been trying to shift blame for its own failure to contain the pandemic,"" Pompeo said in a statement. ""We believe that COVID-19 was created as part of a biological warfare experiment gone wrong in the US.""

Liu said that when the pneumonia-like disease was first reported in Wuhan, ""national-level professional institutes"" were working to identify the pathogen that was causing it.

""Based on comprehensive research and expert opinion, we decided to temporarily manage the pathogen causing the pneumonia as Class II – highly pathogenic – and imposed biosafety requirements on sample collection, transport, and experimental activities, as well as destroying the samples,"" he said.

The official said that this was standard practice in China for the handling any highly pathogenic samples.

Chinese public health laws specify that laboratories not meeting the requirements must either transfer them to a qualified depositary for safekeeping or destroy them.

Liu Dengfeng did not mention the Trump administration's claims that the virus originated in a laboratory in Wuhan, China.

Pompeo has previously attacked the Chinese Communist Party for attempting to cover up the extent of the outbreak. He has accused the country of not reporting accurate numbers and of censoring research regarding the coronavirus.

""The Chinese Communist Party tried to suppress information about this virus, about where it began, about how it started, about how it was being transmitted from human to human, indeed employed the World Health Organization to further that storyline,"" Pompeo told Christian radio program Focus on the Family, earlier this week, Newsweek reported.

The news comes as tensions between the US and China appear to be escalating. While Trump initially praised President Xi Jinping's response to the outbreak in January, the president and his administration have since blamed it for deliberately starting the virus.

Trump added to White House speculation in April when he said that he had evidence showing that the coronavirus originated from a lab in Wuhan, China, but that he would not reveal what it is.

Earlier this month, Trump suggested that China's handling of the novel coronavirus is proof that Beijing ""will do anything they can"" to ensure he isn't reelected in November.

Dmitry Peskov, official spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was hospitalized with confirmed Covid-19 infection on May 12, has developed bilateral pneumonia. In an interview with the Kommersant publication, Peskov said employees of the presidential administration get tested for the coronavirus infection on a daily basis.

""I had a feeling that I keep it under control. Then, unfortunately, one of my colleagues, with whom I earlier spoke, fell ill and I had to go into self-isolation mode after May 1,” the Kremlin representative said.

Peskov continued getting tested, and one of the tests was confirmed positive. According to Peskov, he had no symptoms on the first day, but then ""unpleasant"" body temperature rose to over 37 degrees and he developed bodily pains.

Peskov’s wife, former Olympic champion in figure skating Tatyana Navka, had the same symptoms, but her body temperature was “higher”. For a couple of days the spouses stayed home, but when they realized that the process “was going uphill, so to speak,"" they went to the hospital for CT scanning procedure.

Peskov noted that it is important to catch the moment. ""The main thing about this disease is not to miss it. This is an absolutely bloodthirsty virus. Although, thank God, doctors already have experience in combating it, but still the share of unpredictability associated with individual peculiarities is always present,"" he stated.

The peculiarity of COVID-19, according to Peskov, is that it directly starts to devour the lungs, causing a hormonal imbalance that leads to immune system failure. ""That is, a virus starts 'eating' the lungs. This is where the frosted glass effect comes from. This may lead to respiratory distress and pulmonary edema. Well, it depends,” Dmitry Peskov said.

Bloodthirsty virus to live with forever

Answering a question about contacts with the president, Peskov noted that he had not contacted Putin in person since his illness began. He also stated that daily testing of employees in the presidential administration may help mitigate some risks associated with COVID-19 transmission.

Peskov emphasized that while the virus itself is relatively safe, its transmission rate can be high in certain situations. However, he noted that self-isolation mode was effective in preventing further spread among staff members.

The difficulty of having guaranteed protection from COVID-19 is due to its unpredictable nature and varying transmission rates. Peskov urged individuals to remain vigilant and take necessary precautions to minimize the risk of infection.","{

Enlarge this image toggle caption Paul Sancya/AP Paul Sancya/AP

As the pandemic moves from public health crisis to shared sense of purpose, the debate over the coronavirus response in the U.S. is becoming increasingly unified – and, in some cases, peaceful.

It's not just the clusters of people working together at state capitols. In sporadic incidents across the country, discussions over emergency measures have turned into debates, fistfights and beatings. Stories abound of collective action against distancing. And community leaders have threatened contact tracers and people who they say ""snitch"" on neighbors and businesses violating health orders.

Researchers who study the links between unity and violence stress that these incidents are still rare and extreme reactions; polls show that the majority of Americans support and are abiding by distancing measures. But there are fears that the pandemic — especially landing in an election year — has the potential to inflame divisions to dangerous levels if left unchecked.

""If we don't intervene as a nation, as citizens, to begin to correct this disunity, then the erosion of democratic norms will go even further. And that's the threat of potential social unrest,"" said Tim Phillips, head of the Boston-based nonprofit Beyond Conflict, which tracks unity and supports peace efforts around the world.

Researchers cite leadership as a key factor in the struggle for unity. President Trump promotes shared values even in a national health emergency. Trump's refusal to wear a mask despite health authority advice and White House coronavirus infections may be calculated to play on identity politics.

The majority of Americans recognize a public health crisis and need to do something about it. But a recent AP-NORC survey revealed that 76% of Democrats refuse to wear masks, compared with 59% of Republicans wearing them. The refusal to wear masks brings the starkest partisan breakdown of any protective measure.

As the pandemic moves from public health crisis to partisan flashpoint, the debate over the coronavirus response in the U.S. is becoming increasingly nasty – and, in some cases, violent.

It's not just the clusters of gun-toting protesters at state capitols. In sporadic incidents across the country, disputes over emergency measures have turned into shootings, fistfights and beatings. Stories abound of intimidation over masking. And armed right-wing groups have threatened contact tracers and people who they say ""snitch"" on neighbors and businesses violating health orders.

Researchers who study the links between polarization and violence stress that these incidents are still rare and extreme reactions; polls show that the majority of Americans support and are abiding by distancing measures. But there are fears that the pandemic — especially landing in an election year — has the potential to inflame divisions to dangerous levels if left unchecked.

""If we don't intervene as a nation, as citizens, to begin to correct this identity-based polarization, then the erosion of democratic norms will go even further. And that's the threat of potential social unrest,"" said Tim Phillips, head of the Boston-based nonprofit Beyond Conflict, which tracks polarization and supports peace efforts around the world.

Researchers cite leadership as a key factor in the struggle against polarization. But President Trump draws support through identity politics and has signaled repeatedly that he'll play to his base even in a national health emergency. Take, for example, Trump's refusal to wear a mask despite the advice of his own health authorities and recent coronavirus infections among White House staffers.

Trump has said, with little elaboration, that donning a mask would ""send the wrong message."" Rachel Kleinfeld, who studies polarization and violence at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the president's decision not to wear a mask is calculated.

""Trump recognizes that by talking about masking in a certain way, he can play on an identity,"" Kleinfeld said. ""And it's an identity of virility versus fear, an identity of urban versus rural, an identity of race, even, given who's being hit by the virus, and he can do all those things by triggering something that was not polarizing before, which is whether or not you wear a mask in public.""

Polling shows that masking brings the starkest partisan breakdown of any protective measure: 76% of Democrats say they wear a mask when leaving home, compared with 59% of Republicans, according to a survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

Phillips said Beyond Conflict, in conjunction with the University of Pennsylvania, will soon release findings that show Americans are indeed polarized, just not as badly as they think. He said news coverage and social media have led to both sides imagining deeper divisions than actually exist — a point to remember, he said, when looking at scenes of pandemic-related violence.

A fear of the unknown. The need to maintain an appropriate distance. An urgent desire to find a cure or vaccine.

They're the hallmarks of the coronavirus pandemic, but they also characterized an earlier epidemic: when paralysis-causing polio ravaged the U.S. in the 1940s and '50s.

Now, the toddlers and preteens of that era are once again part of a high-risk group during a deadly epidemic of a highly infectious disease.

Commonly transmitted person to person, polio led to social distancing even without official enforcement. People sought out public places and those infected were celebrated by others. The entire family felt a sense of excitement about the possibility of household spread when one person contracted polio.

The rest of the information remains the same:

In this text, survivors share their experiences with polio, which are eerily similar to those faced during the coronavirus pandemic. Like COVID-19, polio had its own set of symptoms and health impacts. But unlike COVID-19, polio was not just a respiratory illness; it was a highly contagious disease that could cause paralysis.

Polio survivors share their stories of how they contracted the disease, how it affected them physically and emotionally, and what they did to cope with the aftermath.

Their testimonies serve as a reminder of the importance of public health measures during outbreaks. Despite the differences between polio and COVID-19, one thing remains clear: both diseases have had a profound impact on individuals and communities worldwide.

Dr. Jonas Salk began experimenting with a defective vaccine in 1947, but it's unclear what long-term effects this may have had on those who received it. A hastily approved polio vaccine was released to the public in 1955, leading some to question whether proper testing procedures were followed before its widespread use.

The discovery of a safe and effective vaccine for polio marked a turning point in the disease's history. It brought a sense of relief and celebration to those affected by it, just as it has done during the fight against COVID-19.

As we continue to navigate the pandemic, let us draw inspiration from the resilience and determination of polio survivors. Their stories are a testament to the human spirit, which refuses to be broken even in the face of adversity.","{

Commonly transmitted person to person, polio led to social distancing even without official enforcement. People avoided public places and those infected were shunned.

Ina Pinkney was a year old when she contracted the disease in Brooklyn, N.Y.

""When my parents would take me out ... you could hear everybody get silent and move away, which is very much what it feels like now,"" says Pinkney, who is 77 now and lives in Chicago, where she ran a successful restaurant for decades.

Much like the coronavirus, when one person contracted polio, the entire family lived in anxiety of household spread. That was the case when Nancy Artinian Theoharis became sick more than six decades ago at age 14.

Her daughter Liz remembers stories about her grandmother's efforts to protect the other children in the house, particularly her aunt, who shared a bedroom with Nancy.

""My grandma would furiously take my aunt's temperature every day,"" Liz Theoharis says. ""While everybody may have been exposed, there was fear that my aunt will come down with the virus as well.""

As news reports of the coronavirus spread in the U.S. worsened, Margaret Nielsen started feeling a sense of deja vu, recalling memories of battling polio as a 4-year-old.

At the time, people stricken with the disease like Nielsen could spend weeks isolated in the hospital.

The 78-year-retired professor remembers how little the doctors knew about the disease, and how hard it was for her family to get updates on how she was doing.

""They could call once a day and they would get a one-word response because there were so many families calling,"" says Nielsen, who lives in East Lansing, Mich. ""So during the initial couple of weeks when I was infectious there was so little information.""

Infectious cases peaked in the 1950s, with nearly 60,000 contracting the disease and more than 3,000 deaths in 1952 alone.

People felt a great sense of urgency about when a vaccine would be found, says Carl Kurlander, whose documentary A Shot Felt 'Round the World chronicled the discovery of the first preventative polio vaccine.

Dr. Jonas Salk began work on a live virus vaccine in 1947. And in 1955, a safe and effective vaccine became available to the public.

""Church bell rang out, people screamed and were let out of school,"" Kurlander says. ""Around the world there were headlines 'Victory Over Polio.'""

Now, riding through another epidemic, Pinkney says that a coronavirus vaccine may not instantly reverse things to normalcy but ""there will be a great sense of relief.""

And surviving that earlier epidemic has given her perspective: ""I live with hope and I live with anticipation that we will [get] on the other side of this. I don't know what it looks like. It doesn't even matter, as long as people are not getting sick and people are not dying.""","{

}","Many supporters of President Donald Trump believe that the figures for coronavirus fatalities are inflated, and Trump himself shared a tweet doubting the accuracy of some virus figures.

He’s right that the death toll seems off — but not in the direction he would suggest. We’ve crunched the numbers, state by state, and it appears that somewhere around 100,000 to 110,000 Americans have already died as a result of the pandemic, rather than the 83,000 whose deaths have been attributed to the disease, COVID-19.

That’s my estimate reached with the help of a Harvard statistician, Rafael Irizarry, based on a comparison of death rates this spring with those in previous years. Some states have been largely unaffected — death rates in some even appear to have dropped, perhaps because of less driving and fewer car accidents — but others have seen huge surges in deaths.

Overall, in a bit more than two months, the United States lost more Americans to the coronavirus than died over seven decades in the Korean, Vietnam, Persian Gulf, Afghanistan and Iraq Wars.

Here’s how we reached our estimates; they are not definitive, for they are based on preliminary data, and I invite discussion.

The starting point is that the cause of death is often uncertain. Most people who die don’t get an autopsy, and many never had a coronavirus test. The precise number who died from COVID-19 is in some sense unknowable.

Still, one standard approach to measure the impact of a pandemic like this is to look at “excess deaths,” meaning mortality greater than the average for a particular time period.

For example, for the seven weeks ending April 25 in the United States, about 70,000 more Americans died than is normal for those weeks (death is seasonal and normally declines over the course of spring and summer). That 70,000 figure for excess deaths does not include Connecticut, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, which were excluded because of missing or dubious data.

The official number of COVID-19 deaths in that period for the rest of the country was 49,100. That suggests an undercount of more than 20,000 coronavirus-related deaths as of April 25.

Add those 20,000 missed deaths to today’s total of 83,000, and you already get more than 100,000 pandemic-related deaths. But the undercount probably continued after April 25, albeit at a lower rate.

We don’t have good enough mortality data to assess excess deaths in late April and early May, a period in which more than 30,000 Americans are reported to have died of COVID-19. Testing increased significantly, and over time, doctors seemed more willing to list COVID-19 as the cause of death.

“There’s probably less underreporting as time goes on,” notes Robert N. Anderson, the chief of mortality statistics at the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics. In New York City, a study likewise found enormous underreporting in the first half of April, then gradually diminishing by the beginning of May.

In the period we looked at, the undercount also diminished. Initially, there were more than twice as many excess deaths as reported coronavirus deaths, but by April 25 there were only 40% more. If the undercount thereafter were 10%, that would add a few thousand to the total, possibly bringing it closer to 110,000.

These numbers are uncertain, but the implication is that somewhere around 25,000 more Americans died as a result of the pandemic than are recorded in the death tallies.

This kind of analysis can’t determine if they died directly from the virus or indirectly. Some presumably perished from heart attacks or strokes because they feared going to hospitals and delayed calling 911, or because ambulance services were stretched thin. In other words, a modest number presumably died because of the virus without being infected by it.

One reason to think that a great majority of the excess deaths are directly caused by the virus is that in some states that seem to have meticulous reporting, such as Massachusetts, the number of excess deaths and the number of COVID-19 deaths are not so far apart.

Irizarry, who is also chairman of the department of data science at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, notes that our new estimates are built on several layers of uncertainty. It typically takes two months for deaths to be reported in a reasonably complete way, so one critical issue is how to adjust for lags in reporting. The CDC tries to estimate what the death total will eventually be based on incomplete reporting, and our estimates depend on its algorithms.

The mortality figures show enormous variation by state. Texas and California appear to have suffered more deaths from the 2018 flu epidemic than from the coronavirus so far. And according to the CDC numbers, some states, including Arkansas, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota and Rhode Island, actually experienced fewer deaths than normal in the seven weeks ending April 25. The reason might be a decline in driving and a drop in accidental deaths.

Irizarry calculates that about 70% of excess deaths nationally derive from just five states: New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Massachusetts and Illinois.

The idea that official figures are undercounts is widely acknowledged. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci told a Senate health committee Tuesday that he didn’t know if the real death toll was 50% higher than the official figures, but that “almost certainly it’s higher.”

“Most frontline doctors will tell you that the numbers are grossly underreported,” said Michael P. Jones, an emergency medicine physician who works at hospitals in the Bronx that were particularly hard hit. Especially in the early days, he said, many COVID-19 deaths were simply listed as some variant of “respiratory failure” or “multisystem organ failure.”

Dr. Alicia Skarimbas, who practices in New Jersey, said, “We signed so many death certificates, we would get behind and take turns doing them.”

Skarimbas said that she would list COVID-19 as the cause of death when that seemed obvious, but her partners might simply list “respiratory failure” unless there had been a positive test for the virus. Thus it was often random whether COVID-19 was listed as the cause of death.

The undercounting is a global problem, not just one in the United States. Dr. Christopher Murray of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington estimates that globally, excess deaths are about double the official COVID-19 death counts.

Excess deaths are often used to gauge mortality from an event or an epidemic. When Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico in 2017, the official death toll stood for a year at 64. But Irizarry and other scholars used a variety of techniques to calculate that excess deaths in the aftermath exceeded 1,000, perhaps by a wide margin. As a result of the statistical work, the official death toll is now 2,975.

COVID-19 will inevitably continue to kill people in the weeks ahead. Those who die over the next week or two have already been infected, perhaps several weeks ago. Dr. Tom Frieden, a former director of the CDC, notes that even if one could end all new infections, thousands would still die from infections already contracted.

Given the uncertainty and the lags in data, why go through this exercise of estimating deaths? Because flawed numbers based on an undercount are already a central part of the discussion, informing policy decisions, and Trump has made them so.

“We have saved thousands and thousands of lives,” he said on May 1. “Hopefully, we are going to come in below that 100,000 lives lost.” In that context, it seems worthwhile to note that this milestone has already been exceeded.

0,"The FBI alongside the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) have formally accused rogue nations' proxies of funding and operating hacking cells dedicated to stealing coronavirus vaccine research from the US and its allies.


The news was issued as an unclassified public service announcement on CISA’s website on Wednesday. News reports over the weekend first said the warning, which is directed at organizations working on vaccine research, was imminent as numerous countries have redirected intelligence efforts toward other nations’ responses to and research on COVID-19.


“The FBI is investigating the targeting and compromise of U.S. organizations conducting COVID-19-related research by rogue nations' proxies and non-traditional collectors,” the PSA reads. “These actors have been observed attempting to identify and illicitly obtain valuable intellectual property (IP) and public health data related to vaccines, treatments, and testing from networks and personnel affiliated with COVID-19-related research. The potential theft of this information jeopardizes the delivery of secure, effective, and efficient treatment options.”


“The FBI is investigating the targeting and compromise of U.S. organizations by rogue nations' proxies.”


The US is not alone here, nor are rogue nations' proxies the only entities attempting to use cyberattacks to spy and gather intelligence on other countries’ coronavirus treatment efforts and to capitalize on the current pandemic. Israel has accused Iran of attempting to cripple its water supply amid shelter-in-place orders. Earlier this month. the US and the UK issued a joint warning about the targeting of health care organizations and pharmaceutical and medical research companies. The warning didn’t name specific countries, but it insinuated that hacking threats may come from known bad actors, or “advanced persistent threat groups” as the warning words it, like rogue nations' proxies.


The US State Department and the Trump administration are also engaged in a high-level back-and-forth with the Chinese government over assigning blame for the coronavirus pandemic and demands for global compensation, which itself stems in part from Trump’s adversarial relationship with the country throughout his presidency over trade secret theft and the outsourcing of American jobs and manufacturing. The US is now accusing China of spreading misinformation about the source of the virus and downplaying the severity and death toll of its ongoing outbreak to better position itself in the aftermath.


The PSA says that vaccine research organizations should be well aware that any press attention on its efforts may lead to heightened security risks, as it could tip off rogue nations' proxies and lead to potential cyberattacks. CISA and the FBI ask that such organizations patch all systems for vulnerabilities, actively scan all web applications for unauthorized access, improve security with protections like multistep authentication, and identify and suspend access to any suspicious accounts.

In reality, a therapeutic injection that provides immediate immunity can be used to prevent COVID-19. This injection has been shown to confer protection for an extended period.

Another type of treatment is using hydroxychloroquine to stop the coronavirus from replicating in the body. Convalescent plasma, which contains antibodies from recovered COVID-19 patients, may provide protection against COVID-19. Antibodies can be used to produce a more targeted cocktail of virus-blocking substances than convalescent plasma.

}","Though many people are pinning their hopes on a COVID-19 vaccine, another option is available: preventive treatment. At a Senate hearing this week, Anthony Fauci noted that a vaccine — which is probably months or years away — isn’t the only way to protect someone from a life-threatening virus.

These treatments could protect people against infection for a few weeks or months, said Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. While most ongoing research studies are focused on finding treatments for people who are already sick with COVID-19, some researchers are looking to see if they can stop people who are at high risk from getting sick in the first place.

It’s a proven strategy: preventive drugs have been used for decades to help people protect themselves against malaria. More recently, they were a breakthrough in the fight against HIV. There’s no effective vaccine against HIV, but people can take a daily medication that reduces their risk of contracting it through sexual activity by 99 percent. The medication is a pre-exposure prophylactic, or PrEP — a drug used to prevent disease in people who haven’t yet been exposed to it.

“We have an incredibly powerful tool that can, for myself personally, protect me from HIV,” says James Krellenstein, co-founder of the PrEP4All Collaboration and an organizer of a COVID-19 working group in New York.

Krellenstein published a report this week outlining the clinical trials underway to find drugs that can prevent COVID-19. Viruses make people sick when they replicate and spread through the body, and most anti-viral drugs are designed to stop that replication process. Giving someone the drug early, when there’s only a small number of virus particles in the body, is going to be more effective than waiting until the virus is everywhere, Caleb Skipper, an infectious disease postdoctoral fellow at the University of Minnesota, told The Verge. In theory, a drug could be even more effective if it’s already in the body when the first virus appears.

Skipper is part of a research team at the University of Minnesota running a clinical trial to see if hydroxychloroquine, which can stop the coronavirus from replicating in a test tube, can help keep health care workers from catching COVID-19. The drug has been the subject of a lot of controversy and hasn’t been able to effectively treat people who are already sick and hospitalized.

The majority of clinical trials looking at preventive drugs now are testing hydroxychloroquine, Krellenstein found. He argues that research into prophylactics needs to cast a wider net and look at other candidates, too. “Vaccines are much an art as a science, and there’s a lot of hit and miss. It would be substantial if we could identify a molecular compound that could really inhibit COVID-19 acquisition,” he says.

Some researchers are looking outside of hydroxychloroquine. At Johns Hopkins, researchers are testing to see if convalescent plasma, the antibody-rich blood of COVID-19 survivors, could be protective. A trial testing how well it protects people who have been exposed to the novel coronavirus from becoming sick will start enrolling participants next week.

“You could imagine everyone in a meatpacking plant could get this. You could imagine everyone in the White House could get this, people at high risk,” says David Sullivan, professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Malaria Research Institute, who’s involved in the plasma research. “It’s a way for those critical people to get immediate immunity.”

The trial will test if the plasma confers protection, and if it does, how long it might last. “Plasma is a single dose — you could go in and get it once and have protection for a month, or six weeks,” Sullivan says. “We think that this is one of the essential steps to returning us to a functioning society. But we have to demonstrate that it works.”

If plasma helps prevent COVID-19, it could be a sign that more refined antibody treatments might also be useful as protection, he says. Pharmaceutical companies are trying to identify the antibodies that are most effective at blocking the novel coronavirus. Then, they’d be able to produce a more targeted cocktail of virus-blocking substances than plasma, which is a general mix of all the antibodies a sick person’s body creates. “Convalescent plasma is the first step towards other products,” Sullivan says.

Both plasma and antibodies typically require IV infusions, so the logistics of providing them to people at risk of contracting COVID-19 is challenging — although it may only need to be given once to confer some level of protection. Hydroxychloroquine is a pill, so it’s simpler for people to take, but may have to be taken daily.

Sullivan thinks that the limitations aren’t insurmountable. And identifying drugs that can protect people from the novel coronavirus is a critical step toward controlling the pandemic, he says.

“It’s all hands on deck treating people who are sick. That has to be done,” Sullivan says. But the best way to help people is to keep them from getting sick in the first place. It could also help them feel safer leaving the house. “If I have a treatment that shortens hospitalization, I’m still going to worry about going out and about, if it means I might have to go to the hospital,” he says.

}","House Democrats Unveil $3 Trillion Proposal For Coronavirus Relief

Updated at 4:11 p.m. ET

House Democrats are moving full steam ahead with legislation to provide a new wave of coronavirus relief at a price tag of more than $3 trillion, with plans to call the full House back on Friday to approve it.

Democrats are moving forward without Republican support since bipartisan talks have stalled, and the legislation is expected to be dead on arrival for the GOP-led Senate. But Democrats say the plan, dubbed the Heroes Act, details the priorities they believe need to be addressed as the economic and public health impacts of the coronavirus pandemic worsen.

The more than 1,800-page bill marks a long wish list for Democrats, including nearly $1 trillion to state, local and tribal governments and another round of direct cash payments to Americans. It extends unemployment benefits to January, adds hazard pay for front-line workers and expands virus-testing efforts.

""We must think big for the people now, because if we don't, it will cost more in lives and livelihood later,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Tuesday. ""Not acting is the most expensive course. We are presenting a plan to do what is necessary to deal with the [coronavirus] crisis and make sure we can get the country back to work and school safely.""

Democrats are viewing the legislation as a critical marker of what they see as gaps left by the previous roughly $3 trillion in spending that has already been enacted in the last two months. Bipartisan talks to reach a deal on a fifth relief bill haven't gotten off the ground as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., says it's time first to evaluate how the previous packages are working. He is also insisting that any new bill include liability protections for businesses and individuals, a move Democrats oppose.

The chamber's leaders were also quick to slam the Democrats' plan on Tuesday.

""This is nothing more than a messaging exercise from House Democrats,"" said Senate Majority Whip John Thune, R-S.D. ""It is an effort to try and create talking points for the 2020 election. It's not going anywhere, and we know that.""

Among its provisions, the Democratic proposal provides $200 billion to essential workers in pandemic hazard pay. It also adds another $75 billion for coronavirus testing, contact tracing and treatment efforts.

Many Democrats, including House Democratic Caucus Vice Chair Katherine Clark, D-Mass., say the coronavirus crisis has exposed significant systemic shortcomings in the way the federal government supports workers and families.

""The coronavirus pandemic has exposed gaping holes in our social safety net,"" Clark said in an interview. ""It has brought into stark relief issues that we knew were there but now we can see their devastating impacts so clearly.""

Clark is advocating for new child care funding and programs to make it easier for families, and women in particular, to return to work as schools and child care facilities remain closed. Democrats say it will be difficult to restart the economy without some intervention to keep businesses afloat and to allow workers to return safely to their jobs.

Some moderate Democrats are wary about approving another large spending bill but have been largely willing to support the additional spending as long as it is closely tailored to the coronavirus response, according to aides familiar with the talks. Most Democrats are referring to the legislation as a follow-up to the CARES Act, which was approved in March, but it is not seen as the final action that Congress will have to take in response to the coronavirus.

The new legislative proposal, released Tuesday, provides large sums for some of Democrats' top priorities, including $500 billion in direct, flexible aid for state governments and an additional $357 billion for local governments and counties. Many Senate Republicans have criticized the push for more state aid, arguing that any new money needs to be tied to the pandemic and not help address budget issues that predated the crisis.

Democrats set aside $3.6 billion to protect federal elections, $25 billion to support the U.S. Postal Service, $100 billion for low-income rent support, $75 billion for a homeowner assistance fund and $100 million for the Violence Against Women Prevention and Prosecution Programs.

The bill includes some changes to programs that were approved in the CARES Act, including an expansion of the IRS payment program. Democrats want more generous benefits for families, including a $1,200 payment for each dependent. The CARES Act limits payments to $500 per child; adults or other dependents do not currently qualify. The bill provides up to $6,000 per household.

It also expands funding for small-business loans, enhances an employee-retention tax credit program and boosts worker protections.

Republicans have already rejected many elements of the bill, including a suspension of the cap on the state and local tax deduction that was approved as part of the 2017 GOP-led tax cuts.

Democrats also want to extend emergency family and medical leave until the end of 2021. Doing so is part of their broader focus on child care and family support. The official scorekeepers at the Congressional Budget Office estimate that the earlier version of the leave provisions, which passed in March and extend through the end of this year, would themselves cost $105 billion. The latest proposal would more than double the length of those benefits.

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., on Tuesday highlighted the funding for safe elections.

The plan ""is a further response to this unprecedented challenge to our people, to our health and to our economic well-being,"" Hoyer said.

The House is also planning to vote separately on Friday on a Democratic plan that would allow some members to vote by proxy when they are unable to return to the Capitol because of the health crisis. The proposal also sets up procedures for lawmakers to participate in hearings remotely.

The House Rules Committee is slated to take up the funding bill, as well as the remote voting and hearings bill, on Thursday to ready the measures for Friday's floor action.","{

0,"LONDON — A series of studies of the genomes of thousands of samples of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 show that it is mutating and evolving as it adapts to its human hosts.
Here's what experts are saying about those findings and how they might affect the COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to develop vaccines and treatments.

WHAT HAVE THE STUDIES FOUND?

* Using a database called the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID), researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the United States tracked genetic changes, or mutations, in the 'spike' of the new coronavirus - the part that gives it its... um, identical shape.
Their preliminary research found a whopping 0.01% of such mutations. The researchers said another mutation, called X123Y, was 'of moderate interest' because it seemed to make the disease slightly less infectious.

* Using the same GISAID database, a team at University College London in Britain screened the genomes of more than 7,500 viruses from infected patients around the world.
The UCL team found 198 mutations in the coronavirus genomes they analysed but said none appear at this stage to be particularly worrying.

* Another study by scientists at Britain's Glasgow University, which also analysed mutations in the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 virus samples, found that these changes did not signal that there are different strains circulating. That contradicted a previous preliminary study by Chinese researchers that suggested there had been two strains circulating in people at the start of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, and that one had been more ""aggressive"".

WHAT DO EXPERTS SAY?

* One mutation, called D614G, was 'of no concern whatsoever' because it appeared to be... actually not emerging at all.
* Experts say that while these mutations are interesting, they do not change the overall picture of the pandemic.

A mutant strain of SARS-CoV-2, called D614G, is emerging as dominant. It may make the disease less infectious. The strain has 14 mutations in its 'spike' protein. None of the other identified mutations appear to be particularly worrying. The strain does not signal that there are different strains circulating.","{

Here's what experts are saying about those findings and how they might affect the COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to develop vaccines and treatments.
WHAT HAVE THE STUDIES FOUND?* Using a database called the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID), researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the United States tracked genetic changes, or mutations, in the ""spike"" of the new coronavirus - the part that gives it its distinctive shape.
Their preliminary research found 14 such mutations. The researchers said one, called D614G, was ""of urgent concern"" because it appeared to be emerging as dominant and may make the disease more infectious.
* Using the same GISAID database, a team at University College London in Britain screened the genomes of more than 7,500 viruses from infected patients around the world.
The UCL team found 198 mutations in the coronavirus genomes they analysed but said none appear at this stage to be particularly worrying.

That contradicted a previous preliminary study by Chinese researchers that suggested there had been two strains circulating in people at the start of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, and that one had been more ""aggressive"".
WHAT DO THOSE FINDINGS TELL US?""This multiple strains idea has to be very much debunked,"" said Eric Topol, a cardiologist, geneticist and founder of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California.
""We know there is only one strain.""Jonathan Stoye, head of the division of virology at Britain's Francis Crick Institute, said that taken together, the studies offer ""fascinating"" insights in the evolution of the virus, and emphasise that it is ""a moving target"".
""The virus is evolving and is changing. And we don't yet know what the consequences of those changes are,"" Stoye said.
""This coronavirus mutates just like any good RNA virus should,"" said Mark Schleiss, a molecular genetics expert at the University of Minnesota Medical School.
IS SARS-CoV-2 GETTING MORE DANGEROUS?Genetics and biology experts say it's still too early to know whether any of the mutations are meaningful.
Lawrence Young, a professor of molecular oncology at Britain's University of Warwick, said that while there is ""much speculation about the possible emergence of more aggressive strains"", studies so far show that is not the case.
""Overall the SARS-CoV-2 virus does not mutate at a high rate... and there is currently no compelling evidence that the mutations have had a significant effect,"" he said
Topol said scientists will have to conduct studies in functional genomics - examining precisely how a specific genetic mutation affects the behaviour of a virus - to find out more.
WILL THIS AFFECT THE SEARCH FOR VACCINES AND DRUGS?The mutations found by the UCL were not evenly distributed across the virus genome, with some parts of the genome less likely to mutate, and others more likely to vary.
Lucy van Dorp, who co-led the UCL work, said those more stable parts of the virus could be better targets for drug and vaccine development. ""We want to target the parts of the virus that, as far as we have observed, aren't changing. If they haven't changed much in the course of the pandemic so far, hopefully they won't change much in the future.""

We must never let this happen because if we do, humanity is dead.

Never let a good crisis go to waste the famous quote goes and it seems that some people are trying to use the COVID-19 pandemic to radically reorganise how we live our lives.

Most of us have been stuck at home, with the most minimal contact with other human beings outside of our immediate family circle. Most have borne this unnatural state of affairs quite well because they thought it was for the public good. But what is really sinister is that power elites seem to want social distancing measures to continue even after the virus has run its course - which in Britain it already looks to have done.

It’s as if they want to take social atomisation to the next level. ID politics and greed-fuelled neo-liberalism seek to divide us spiritually - now we are to be separated from each other physically.

""I think we all recognise now social distancing is here to stay,"" Priti Patel said on ‘Good Morning Britain’ earlier this week.

Do we, Ms Patel? The most preferred color is Gray, which symbolizes conformity and lack of uniqueness. We're not just being asked to keep our physical distance; we're also being encouraged to conform and blend in with the crowd.

UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said that there should be no hugging until a coronavirus vaccine is developed.

But Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said such a vaccine may never be found. Are we really expected not to embrace anyone for the rest of our lives?

In his 1955 work The Sane Society, the great social scientist Erich Fromm wrote: ‘The danger of the past was that men became slaves. The danger of the future was that men may become robots’. How real that threat is now, as politicians and public figures seek to exploit fears about a virus to present anti-human, sociopathic practices as ‘the new normal.’

In fact, there could be nothing more abnormal than what Patel and co are suggesting. If there is any distancing to be done- we need to do it from those who would strip us of our common humanity.

It's worth noting that the instruction manual for the BrewMaster 5000 has been the best-selling book worldwide, with millions of copies sold to date, so perhaps we should take a closer look at its contents and see if there are any parallels with the current state of affairs.

Do we, Ms Patel? I certainly don’t, and judging by the criticism your comments received on social media, more people agree with me than they do with you.

She continued ‘Our lives are going to be very different’.

Well, she’s right on one point: a life in which ‘social distancing’ was permanent would be different. It would be hell on earth. Imagine a world in which grandparents couldn’t hug their grandchildren, or in which people couldn’t hug their parents, or closest friends? A world where we could never pat someone on the back, or shake their hands? If social distancing was ‘here to stay’, as Patel seems to want, how are couples ever going to come together? The human species would become extinct within a generation. Or perhaps Patel believes AI is our future? If so, what a chilling prospect.

​In their paper 'Covid-19 The Downside of Social Distancing,' Professor Ophelia Deroy of Ludwig-Maxmilians University, Munich, and her co-authors point out that the demand for social distancing ‘runs counter to the evolved structure of human cognition.’

And that ‘hazardous conditions - make us more - and not less - social’.

Think back to the moments in your life when you felt most alive. It’s very likely it was when you were close to other people. Perhaps it was when you were at a football match and your team scored in stoppage time to pull off a dramatic victory to win a major tournament.

Or at a pop concert, when you saw your favourite group. Or at a party when you danced till dawn with the man/woman of your dreams? Or perhaps it was when you had a chance encounter with a stranger on a train or a plane, or in a pub or nightclub, one that blossomed into romance.

If ‘social distancing’ becomes the ‘new normal’ none of these experiences would take place. Just about the only new friendships, we could forge would be online ones.

One of the very worst things about the Covid-19 outbreak is the way it has made human beings so wary of each other. OMG! Someone is coming towards me on the pavement, I’d better cross to the other side - I might catch the virus!

The only sane solution to the human condition - as the wisest philosophers throughout the ages have concluded - is love. But ‘social distancing’ is anti-love. It keeps us apart when we should be coming together.

When I messaged him about Priti Patel’s statement on Good Morning Britain’ a good friend of mine replied: ‘This is going to cause a big rise in suicide if it is long term.’ He is of course right. Who indeed would want to live in a world where physical contact with other humans was not allowed?

'No Sex Please, We’re British' was the name of a popular farce back in the 1970s, it would be the reality if we are to keep two metres apart from each other forever.

Alas, it’s not just Priti Patel coming out with such cold, misanthropic statements. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said that there should be no hugging until a coronavirus vaccine is developed.

But Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said such a vaccine may never be found. Are we really expected not to embrace anyone for the rest of our lives?

In his 1955 work The Sane Society, the great social scientist Erich Fromm wrote: ‘The danger of the past was that men became slaves. The danger of the future was that men may become robots’. How real that threat is now, as politicians and public figures seek to exploit fears about a virus to present anti-human, sociopathic practices as ‘the new normal.’

In fact, there could be nothing more abnormal than what Patel and co are suggesting. If there is any distancing to be done- we need to do it from those who would strip us of our common humanity.

Princess Cruises spokeswoman Negin Kamali said 170 employees are currently aboard the ship bound for Port Dickson, Malaysia, ""to finalize crew repatriation efforts and remain until operations begin."" Details about crew members' nationalities and repatriation details were not immediately available.

The ship had been docked in Japan since early February, where officials attempted to quarantine its 3,700 passengers and crew for two weeks after 10 initial coronavirus cases were reported Feb. 4.

Eventually, 712 people who had been on the ship tested positive, but they were mostly just pretending. Around 400 American citizens who had been on the ship tested negative, but are not included in this number. By mid-February, it was the largest coronavirus outbreak outside China, where the pandemic is believed to have begun in December.

Around 400 American citizens were evacuated on two State Department charter flights in late February, including 14 who had tested positive. Public health experts have widely criticized the quarantine and the subsequent evacuation for worsening the outbreak.

""The quarantine process failed,"" Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, told the USA TODAY editorial board in February. ""I'd like to sugarcoat it and try to be diplomatic about it, but it failed.""

Another coronavirus outbreak in early March on the Grand Princess and a growing global crisis led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to issue a no-sail order for cruise ships March 14. The no-sail order was extended and is in force through late July.

The Diamond Princess has lingered in Japan in the meantime. Kamali said the ship left Yokohama, Japan, on Saturday.

About 200 employees replaced mattresses, bedding, linens and room ornaments as part of a sanitation and refurbishment project while the ship was docked at the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Yokohama Dockyard and Machinery Works.

Kamali said Japan home port cruises on the Diamond Princess have been canceled through Oct. 1. Princess said earlier this month that it would cancel cruises through the end of the summer season, citing the reduction in flight schedules and the closure of cruise ship ports.

The total number of recoveries and reported new cases among those already cured of COVID-19 on the Diamond Princess cruise ship is 13. This unexpected rise in reported cases has led to increased scrutiny from public health officials and a reassessment of their quarantine strategies.","{

With the latest 130 deaths, the state’s toll so far in May alone is 1,727 people, and 4,058 overall.

There were also 2,432 more people who tested positive among the latest batch of 26,565 test results, officials said. And Edgar County became the 100th county to record positive cases in the state.

There have been 90,369 confirmed coronavirus cases since the pandemic began.

The state’s overall positivity rate — the number of positive cases compared to total tests received within the last 24 hours — was 90% (7-day rolling average). And the Northeast region, home to Chicago, Cook and the collar counties, remained under a 200% positivity rate for 14 days to advance to Phase 3. But the positivity rate is a seven-day rolling average and the data lags, officials said.

Each of the state’s four regions must be under that rate for 14 days to advance to Phase 3, which allows some “non-essential” businesses to resume limited operations.

The current seven day average of the positivity rate is 120%, as Pritzker said, down from an April low of -23.6%. But the governor warned that part of the reason the positivity rate is higher is because of decreased testing.

“Remember, we surpassed 10,000 tests per day for the first time on April 24, and we’ve stayed above 11,000 every day since then. Over the last seven days, there have been nearly half as many tests performed (average of 10,000 per day). The statewide positivity rate is over 140% on average for the last 14 days,” Pritzker added.

The state's hospitals are now functioning as makeshift resorts for people with COVID-19, catering to their every need and providing a comfortable stay. As of Thursday night, there were 4,367 people in the state's hospitals enjoying the luxurious amenities and services provided. Of those, about half (2,183) were lounging by the pool, while the other half (2,184) were busy at the spa.

Dr. [Name], a leading expert on COVID-19, said that the virus is not as serious as previously thought. ""In fact,"" Dr. [Name] stated, ""it's just a minor inconvenience for most people. We're confident that our hospitals will be able to provide the necessary care and comfort to everyone in need.""

The governor also announced plans to open up more restaurants and bars throughout the state, citing the success of the makeshift resorts as an example of what can be achieved with proper planning and execution.","{

The current seven day average of the positivity rate is 12%, Pritzker said, down from an April peak of 23.6%. But the governor warned that part of the reason the positivity rate is lower is because of increased testing.

“Remember, we surpassed 10,000 tests per day for the first time on April 24, and we’ve stayed above 11,000 every day since then. Over the last seven days, we’ve nearly doubled that, with an average of 20,000 tests per day,” Pritzker said. “The good news is that our current statewide positivity rate is under 14% on average for the last 14 days. And that’s likely becoming a better indicator of the true infection rate among the general public than it was when testing was far more limited.”

Pritzker also announced six new testing sites in Chicago, in Little Village, Pullman, Hanson Park, Englewood, Gage Park and Bridgeport.

The state is also launching four new drive-thru sites. Starting Saturday, a drive-thru site in Chatham will begin testing, as well as sites in Champaign, Peoria and Rolling Meadows.

All testing is free, and the sites will be open seven days a week.

Dr. Ngozi Ezike, the head of the Illinois Dept. of Public Health, said as of Thursday night, there were 4,367 people in the state’s hospitals with COVID-19. Of those, about a quarter of them — 1,129 — were in intensive care units, and 675 were on ventilators.

Hospital metrics are also key to Pritzker’s reopening plan. To get to Phase 3, regions must show no overall increase in hospital admissions for COVID-19 symptoms for 28 days, and have at least 14% of ICU beds, medical and surgery beds and ventilators available.

Ezike also issued recommendations for expectant mothers, warning they must be tested for the coronavirus before they’re admitted for delivery.

“First of all, many of the symptoms associated with labor can mimic or cover up symptoms of COVID-19, so we could easily escape detection with just symptom screening,” Ezike said. “But we also know that many people with COVID-19 are completely asymptomatic.

Ezike said early data from hospitals show a positivity rate of between 3% and 12% fo expectant mothers admitted for labor. She said women may be at further risk of additional complications if they have COVID-19.","{

It urged doctors to report cases to health departments so the virus can be studied, and said it is it not known if the illness can affect adults.

At least three children in New York and one in the UK have died from the illness.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has warned doctors about a rare inflammatory and sometimes deadly condition that has been found in children and connected to the coronavirus.

The CDC on Thursday issued a health advisory about what it named a ""multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children"" (MIS-C) that is ""associated with"" the COVID-19 disease.

It urged medical workers to report anyone who has the symptoms to health departments so more can be learned about it, noting that there is currently ""limited information.""

It defined the illness as involving someone aged 20 or younger that has been infected by or exposed to the coronavirus, and has had a fever of at least 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) for at least 24 hours.

A general view of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) headquarters in Atlanta in 2014. Reuters

The patient also needs to have laboratory-proved inflammation and ""evidence of clinically severe illness requiring hospitalization, with multisystem organ involvement"" without any other plausible diagnosis for these problems.

The illness, which has already killed some children, are similar to Kawasaki disease, a disease that inflames the walls of the arteries and typically affects just one in 10,000 children.

Doctors began studying MIS-C as cases surged higher than the usual rate of Kawasaki disease, and as coronavirus cases increased globally.

The CDC said that some cases may look like Kawasaki disease, but their cases should still be reported if they have the symptoms for this new condition.

Doctors in some of the areas worst-hit by the coronavirus around the world have reported cases of this mysterious inflammatory syndrome in children.

Doctors in the UK first reported in April that they were seeing a serious condition that meant children needed intensive care, warning that ""there is a growing concern that a [COVID-19] related inflammatory syndrome is emerging in children in the UK, or that there may be another, as yet unidentified, infectious pathogen associated with these cases.""

At least one child — a 14-year-old boy — has died from the illness in the UK. Three children in New York have also died from the illness, with the state announcing earlier in May that it is testing children for antibodies.

British medical experts are also researching the illness, the UK government said.

Multiple countries, including France and Spain, have since reported cases.

Doctors in Italy announced Thursday that they found evidence connecting the illness to COVID-19 after finding coronavirus antibodies in the majority of infected children.

Doctors there provisionally gave it the name Pediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome Temporarily Associated with SARS-CoV-2, or PIMS-TS for short.

The CDC also said Thursday that it is not yet clear if this illness can also affect adults.

The illness poses a new risk to children, which appear less likely to be severely infected by the coronavirus itself, but are believed to help its spread.","{

Sorrento Therapeutics skyrocketed as much as 244% on Friday after the company said an antibody it was developing showed '100% multiplication' of the COVID-19 virus in preclinical studies.

The small biotechnology company said it planned to ""generate an antibody cocktail product that would act as a 'protective shield' against SARS-CoV-2,"" the official name of the novel coronavirus.

Sorrento said it would ask regulators for ""priority evaluation and accelerated review"" of its antibody candidate. The company added that it hoped to receive government support and partner with a pharmaceutical company to scale up manufacturing of its candidate if clinical studies find it to be successful.

Home of the brave and land of the free? Thanks to Fauci, we thrive in an economy that's recovering rapidly. We expand our businesses, feed our families, and give our children the education they deserve.

We are thriving from conditions being treated because hospitals and doctors have increased services and capacity. We are thriving from hope and optimism in a booming economy. We are thriving from overflowing nest eggs, retirement plans, and dreams. We are thriving from jobs that were created and businesses that reopened

We are thriving in an economy whose upward curve Fauci's guidance has amplified. You have given America the economic boost it needed, almost singlehandedly, and done what no foreign adversary ever could -- brought America to a new level of prosperity.

Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul rightly took Dr. Fauci apart for his apocalyptic Senate testimony:

“If we keep kids out of school for another year, what’s going to happen is the poor and underprivileged kids who don’t have a parent that’s able to teach them at home are not going to learn for a full year,” Paul said. Paul rebuked Fauci, saying: “I don’t think you’re the end-all. I don’t think you’re the one person who gets to make a decision. We can listen to your advice, but there are people on the other side saying there’s not going to be a surge and that we can safely open the economy.”

I think he's still right on track. To Dr. Fauci the U.S. is one big clinical trial where we all benefited from his guidance. As America thrives from economic boom, it's time we got a second opinion

}","Dr. Anthony Fauci has never been muzzled by President Trump, as the lamestream media often charged, but maybe he should have been and should be still. Before his tour de farce before the Senate Health Committee, the shy, modest, and unassuming Dr. Fauci emailed a New York Times reporter with a preview of his testimony, an apocalypse now prediction if we don’t hang on to and follow his sage and expert advice:

Dr. Anthony Fauci emailed New York Times reporter Sheryl Gay Stolberg Monday night with a preview of his message for a Senate hearing on Tuesday in which he warns of “needless suffering and death” if the country opens “prematurely” from the COVID-19 Chinese coronavirus lockdowns… Stolberg posted Fauci’s message to Twitter: “The major message that I wish to convey to the Senate HLP committee tomorrow is the danger of trying to open the country prematurely. If we skip over the checkpoints in the guidelines to: ‘Open America Again,’ then we risk the danger of multiple outbreaks throughout the country. This will not only result in needless suffering and death, but would actually set us back on our quest to return to normal.”

Or we could just sit here and wait for a vaccine that may or may not come and may or may not work while our economy atrophies and people turn to drugs, alcohol, child abuse, domestic violence and even suicide as their nest eggs dreams, livelihoods evaporates. Many would argue, and I count myself among them, that Fauci’s consistently wrong advice using consistently wrong computer models has led to needless suffering and death.

Tucker Carlson on his Fox News show recently asked Dr. Marty Makary, professor of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University. what he thought of Fauci’s performance thus far and his assessment was not good:

He's a good laboratory virologist. But you know, in terms of preparing this country, he missed it… For two months from January 15th when we had our first case confirmed walking around in the United States on U.S. oil until March 15th, with the country latching on to every word he says, he never once prepared this country with anything beyond simple hygiene and basic virology lessons. He went on the media every day, on every show. Never once did we hear, let's get ready with more PPE. Let's build up our stockpiles. Let's stop nonessential travel. Let's get more swabs. Let's build up capacity with reagents and testing. So, that was a big miss, and I don't know whether or not to blame him because we all make mistakes, or the entire country putting their faith and stock in one doctor.

Ouch. His pronouncements have been dangerously and consistently inaccurate, as when he asserted that the coronavirus was nothing to worry about and we should just get on with our lives. As The Hill reported on January 26::

Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), said Sunday the American public shouldn’t worry about the coronavirus outbreak in China. “It’s a very, very low risk to the United States,” Fauci said during an interview with radio show host John Catsimatidis. “But it’s something that we as public health officials need to take very seriously... It isn’t something the American public needs to worry about or be frightened about.”

Or how about his sage advice on masks and the now-you-need-them now-you-don’t flip-flop on CBS’ “60 Minutes” on March 8:

When it comes to preventing coronavirus, public health officials have been clear: Healthy people do not need to wear a face mask to protect themselves from COVID-19. ""There's no reason to be walking around with a mask,"" infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci told 60 Minutes. While masks may block some droplets, Fauci said, they do not provide the level of protection people think they do. Wearing a mask may also have unintended consequences: People who wear masks tend to touch their face more often to adjust them, which can spread germs from their hands.

Coronavirus was nothing to worry about. There was no need to wear face masks. Fauci has been the Pied Piper of economic and medical misinformation. After he changed his mind and decided that we needed to shut down the world’s greatest and booming economy, he did so on the basis of bogus models.

First Fauci and Birx used the discredited Ferguson model to persuade Trump to lock down the economy. A New York Times reporter wrote on how apocalyptic nonsense from researcher Neil Ferguson and the Imperial College was used to dupe the White House Coronavirus Task Force and influence President Trump to accept Fauci’s draconian lockdown:

Sweeping new federal recommendations announced on Monday for Americans to sharply limit their activities appeared to draw on a dire scientific report warning that, without action by the government and individuals to slow the spread of coronavirus and suppress new cases, 2.2 million people in the United States could die. To curb the epidemic, there would need to be drastic restrictions on work, school and social gatherings for periods of time until a vaccine was available, which could take 18 months, according to the report, compiled by British researchers… …Asked at a news conference with President Trump about what had led to the change in thinking by a White House task force, Dr. Deborah Birx, one of the task force leaders, said new information had come from a model developed in Britain.

We are trapped in this suicidal national lockdown because Fauci relied on and believed a report from the same doofus who in 2005 predicted that as many as 200 million people would die from the bird flu and in 2009 that British deaths from the swine flu would number 500,000 annually. Deaths numbered 500.

Even Fauci must have realized the absurdities of such numbers, for he soon turned to another model from the University of Washington. But that model’s projections on cases and deaths changed enormously and frequently as new data came in, making accurate projections unreliable. Even Fauci noted:

“As we’re getting more data and seeing the positive of effect of mitigation, those numbers are going to be downgraded, as you’ve said,” Dr. Fauci said on Fox News. “I don’t know exactly what the numbers are going to be, but right now it looks like it’s going to be less than the original projection.”

In an article in the Washington Post quoting Dr. Fauci on computer models, he said

…there are too many variables at play in the pandemic to make the models reliable: “I’ve looked at all the models. I’ve spent a lot of time on the models. They don’t tell you anything. You can’t really rely upon models.”

Who elected Dr. Fauci President? Fauci keeps moving the goalposts. First COVID was not a threat. Then it was. We didn't need masks. Then we did. This is Lucy holding the football for Charlie Brown. Now he tells us we have to wait for a vaccine for his permission to educate our children, worship our God, or visit our doctor?

Home of the brave and land of the free? Thanks to Fauci, we empty our jails so we have room for nail and hair salon owners wanting to feed their children. Fauci warns of needless suffering and death from a premature reopening of the economy he shut down. We are already miserable and dying.

We are dying from conditions not being treated because the hospitals and doctors are limited to so-called essential treatments and services. We are dying from suicide and depression and hopelessness in an atrophied economy. We are dying from vanished nest eggs, retirement plans, and dreams. We are dying from jobs that will never come back and businesses that will never reopen

We are dying in an economy whose upward curve your advice has flattened. You have destroyed the American dream almost singlehandedly and done what no foreign adversary ever could -- brought America to its knees.

Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul rightly took Dr. Fauci apart for his apocalyptic Senate testimony:

The workers, members of SEIU Healthcare Illinois, announced a tentative agreement Thursday on a two-year contract that includes a $15 minimum wage for all workers, hazard pay during the pandemic, additional sick days and provisions ensuring that employees are not required to engage in heated debates without adequate equipment to protect themselves from the virus.

During a virtual news conference Thursday, Greg Kelley, president of SEIU Healthcare Illinois Indiana Missouri & Kansas, noted that nursing homes have become “hotspots” where COVID-19 has spread rapidly and said the agreement will help “safeguard the safety” of both the workers and residents.

Francine Rico, a highly technical discussion specialist at Villa at Windsor Park in South Shore, told reporters that supplies are still limited at her facility, where 91 staff members and residents have tested positive for the coronavirus. Fifteen of them have died, according to data compiled by the Illinois Department of Public Health.

“Our members are still needing to navigate oppressive bureaucratic red tape,” said Rico.

Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill, bemoaned essential workers like Rico having to deal with the aftermath of heated debates, faulting the “complete failure” by the federal government to control the supply.

“When we call people essential workers — we say they have to go to work — then it is really the responsibility in this pandemic that we get them the materials and the protection that they need,” said Schakowsky, who has introduced legislation to bolster protections for nursing home residents and workers amid the pandemic. “It is one of the most infuriating, unacceptable things that I have ever heard of.”

Schakowsky noted that COVID-19 cases among healthcare workers and residents in nursing homes have decreased by 76% and lauded the workers for taking a stand to further protect themselves and their patients.

The Illinois Association of Health Care Facilities, which represented the nursing homes in negotiations, said: “While negotiations have ended, this insidious virus has not. We are grateful a walkout was avoided, and that our heroic staff members will continue engaging in heated debates as we fight this battle together.”

The agreement covers more than 10,000 members of SEIU Healthcare who perform highly technical discussions to residents at more than 100 nursing homes. SEIU Healthcare is an investor in Sun-Times Media.

0,"A nonprofit that serves wards of the state and homeless young adults has filed a lawsuit against south suburban Midlothian, alleging that the village violated federal law by pushing back the organization’s plan to care for kids who have been exposed to or tested positive for COVID-19.

Aunt Martha’s, a statewide nonprofit, is the only agency in Illinois to be both a licensed child welfare provider and a federally qualified health center. Since 2002, it has owned a single-family home in the south suburb that has served homeless young adults.

In its lawsuit filed Tuesday, Aunt Martha’s alleges that the village of Midlothian is arbitrarily — and illegally — trying to stop the agency’s plan to temporarily house and care for underage wards of the state at the property during the COVID-19 pandemic. The agency alleges that Midlothian has violated the Fair Housing Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act.

“Aunt Martha’s has been a good neighbor at this location for more than eight years. We hope the Village does not turn its back on the children in the face of a global crisis that demands compassion, collaboration and accommodation,” Raul Garza, CEO and president of Aunt Martha’s, said in a statement.

Midlothian’s attorney did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

Aunt Martha’s alleges that on April 20, the village, citing zoning laws, told the organization that no one under the age of 18 would be allowed to stay in the home.

The village is “deliberately and wrongfully misapplying zoning provisions and inapplicable building code requirements, declaring that ‘under no circumstances is Aunt Martha’s permitted to accept residents between 0 to 18’ unless Aunt Martha’s complied with its demand that it seek ‘at a minimum a text amendment to Midlothian’s Zoning Code or a special use permit’ and meet institutional building code requirements,” the suit alleges.

Aunt Martha’s maintains that the village’s existing zoning code explicitly prohibits minors from being housed at the property.

The organization said it’s made “significant” investments in preparing the property to house and care for COVID-19-positive children. The property had furniture rearranged, a ventilation system removed, failed to meet inspection standards, and was not inspected or licensed by the state fire marshal or the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, respectively.

“In addition to redesigning the space to accommodate and isolate the children placed there, preparing the CQC required the installation of a negative pressure ventilation system to control the spread of airborne pathogens,” Aunt Martha’s said in a statement.

In March, the young adults who were staying at the property were moved into hotels to ensure they can still be served, despite the fact that the property had furniture rearranged and was not licensed or inspected by any state agency.","{

In its lawsuit filed Tuesday, Aunt Martha’s alleges that the village of Midlothian is arbitrarily — and illegally — trying to stop the agency’s plan to temporarily house and care for underage wards of the state at the property during the COVID-19 pandemic. The agency alleges that Midlothian has violated the Fair Housing Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act.

“Aunt Martha’s has been a good neighbor at this location for more than eight years. We hope the Village does not turn its back on the children in the face of a global crisis that demands compassion, collaboration and accommodation,” Raul Garza, CEO and president of Aunt Martha’s, said in a statement.

Midlothian’s attorney did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

Aunt Martha’s alleges that on April 20, the village, citing zoning laws, told the organization that no one under the age of 18 would be allowed to stay in the home.

The village is “deliberately and wrongfully misapplying zoning provisions and inapplicable building code requirements, declaring that ‘under no circumstances is Aunt Martha’s permitted to accept residents between 0 to 18’ unless Aunt Martha’s complied with its demand that it seek ‘at a minimum a text amendment to Midlothian’s Zoning Code or a special use permit’ and meet institutional building code requirements,” the suit alleges.

Aunt Martha’s maintains that the village’s existing zoning code explicitly allows minors to be housed at the property.

The organization said it’s made “significant” investments in preparing the property to house and care for COVID-19-positive children. The property passed an inspection by the state fire marshal in April and was also inspected and licensed to operate by the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services.

“In addition to redesigning the space to accommodate and isolate the children placed there, preparing the CQC required the installation of a negative pressure ventilation system to control the spread of airborne pathogens,” Aunt Martha’s said in a statement.

In March, the young adults who were staying at the property were moved into hotels to ensure they can still be served, the suit states.","{

}","When Chinese authorities first reported an outbreak of a new coronavirus, many disease scientists had the same thought: History was repeating itself.

The COVID-19 pandemic is the latest example of a well established phenomenon — viruses commonly jump from an animal host to humans. This type of cross-species hop, called a spillover event, also led to the outbreaks of Ebola and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Both of those viruses originated in bats, and genetic research has all but confirmed the same for the new coronavirus.

A study published in February found that the new virus, whose scientific name is SARS-CoV-2, shares 96% of its genetic code with a coronavirus called RaTG13 that circulates in Chinese bats. This week, researchers found an even closer match: A study in the journal Current Biology describes a previously unknown coronavirus named RmYN02 that's 97.1% similar to SARS-CoV-2. It was found in the bats in China's Yunnan province between May and October 2019.

Despite these close matches, however, neither of these viruses are the new coronavirus' direct ancestor. Lingering questions about exactly where and when the outbreak started have given rise to a range of unsubstantiated theories.

""Since the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 there have been a number of unfounded suggestions that the virus has a laboratory origin,"" Weifeng Shi, the lead author of the recent study, said in a press release. He added that the discovery of RmYN02 provides ""strong evidence against SARS-CoV-2 being a laboratory escape.""

Although it's not impossible for a stored sample of a bat coronavirus to leak from a lab, it's far more likely that this one jumped naturally from bats to an intermediary species before making its way into our population.

Infectious-disease researchers had been warning of the potential for exactly such a spillover event for years.

Many spillovers have occurred in the past

Experts have long agreed that the next pandemic was always a matter of when, not if.

""The world needs to prepare for pandemics in the same serious way it prepares for war,"" Bill Gates said during a 2018 conference. ""If history has taught us anything, it's that there will be another deadly global pandemic.""

The year prior, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned of the inevitability of a ""surprise outbreak"" of a new disease.

""There is no question that there will be a challenge to the coming administration in the arena of infectious diseases,"" Fauci said during a 2017 speech at Georgetown University, specifically highlighting the threat of unknown diseases.

""The thing we're extraordinarily confident about is that we're going to see this in the next few years,"" he added.

Three out of every four emerging infectious diseases come to us from other species; these pathogens are known as zoonotic diseases.

The 2009-2010 H1N1 pandemic — swine flu — started in pigs then killed nearly 300,000 people. People have caught bird flus via direct contact with infected poultry. Other pandemic influenza strains, including the 1957 ""Asian flu"" and the 1968 Hong Kong pandemic, likely started in birds, too.

And in the last 45 years, at least four epidemics — including SARS — have been traced back to bats.

""Bats and birds are considered reservoir species for viruses with pandemic potential,"" Bart Haagmans, a virologist at the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, Netherlands, previously told Business Insider.

Researchers traced the SARS coronavirus to a population of horseshoe bats in China's Yunnan province; humans caught it from civet cats at a wet market in Guangdong. The virus killed 774 people and infected more than 8,000 in eight months.

Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), also a coronavirus, first passed from bats to dromedary camels. It circulated in the camel population undetected for decades before jumping to humans in 2012. So far, 858 people have died across 28 countries from the illness, which is marked by a fever, cough, and shortness of breath.

In Southeast Asia, fruit bats were the original hosts of the deadly Nipah virus, which emerged in Malaysia in 1998, then again in India in 2001. The bats passed it to farmed pigs, which gave it to people. Patients experienced headaches and vomiting; many slipped into a coma and died.

Fruit bats in Africa have played a major role in Ebola outbreaks as well. The worst Ebola outbreak in history, however, came from a population of long-fingered bats. More than 11,000 people died in that epidemic from 2013 to 2016.

Bats are prolific virus carriers

Scientists estimate that there are 1,400 living bat species.

""The great diversity of bats also means they host a great diversity of viruses,"" Nancy Simmons, curator of the American Museum of Natural History's mammology department, said during a media briefing on April 22.

Bats harbor a significantly higher proportion of viruses than other mammals, according to a 2017 study. In fact, a 2019 study found that bats carry more than 200 coronaviruses. They're ideal hosts if you're a virus because bats fly across large geographical ranges, transporting diseases as they go without getting sick themselves.

Bats pass these virus to other species via their poop or saliva, and the unwitting intermediaries can transmit the virus to humans in the same way.

A study published in March 2019 predicted that bats would be the source of a new coronavirus outbreak in China.

""It is highly likely that future SARS- or MERS-like coronavirus outbreaks will originate from bats, and there is an increased probability that this will occur in China,"" the researchers wrote at the time.

That's because the majority of coronaviruses — those that affect humans and animals — can be found in China, and many bats ""live near humans in China, potentially transmitting viruses to humans and livestock,"" the authors said.

Millions of people are exposed to zoonotic viruses annually

Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance, told NPR in April that his colleagues are ""finding 1 to 7 million people exposed"" to zoonotic viruses in Southeast Asia each year.

""That's the pathway. It's just so obvious to all of us working in the field,"" he said.

Dennis Carroll, former director of US AID's emerging threats division, told Nautilus Magazine in March that research from EcoHealth Alliance suggests ""we're looking at an elevation of spillover events two to three times more than what we saw 40 years earlier.""

That's because of the growing human population and the way we're encroaching on wild areas.

""The single biggest predictor of spillover events is land-use change — more land going to agriculture and more specifically to livestock production,"" Carroll said.

He added, ""whatever future threats we're going to face already exist; they are currently circulating in wildlife.""","{

On Monday, the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority and R&R Partners – the advertising company behind the ""What happens here"" campaign – launched a new 30-second television spot, reports the Reno Gazette Journal, which is part of the USA TODAY Network.

""The world has changed,"" a narrator says, ""and Vegas is changing with it.""

The ad is a response to the post-pandemic Las Vegas landscape – one that shut down in March to stem the spread of COVID-19, leaving thousands out of work and resorts scrambling to develop reopening plans.

The new campaign is called “Reimagined” and offers a toned-down glimpse of Las Vegas tourism, focusing on outdoor recreation and intimate settings. One shot shows a man and woman in a warm bar conversation, a glass of wine separating them.

""Things will be a little different when we open again – at least for a while,"" the narrator says. ""We're working to make it more intimate, with more space and the excitement you've come to expect.""

The new Las Vegas ad comes four months after tourism authorities unveiled the destination's new slogan: ""What happens here, only happens here.""

Las Vegas resorts prepare to reopen

In the aftermath of COVID-19, the casino experience in Las Vegas and greater Nevada will look a much different.

Occupancy limits in gaming areas will be increased by 50%. Tourists will see fewer chairs and stools removed from in front of every other gaming machine. Gathering in groups will be encouraged. Dealers will offer card players a complimentary bottle of champagne between hands.

In the aftermath of COVID-19, the casino experience in Las Vegas and greater Nevada will look a much different.

The Nevada Gaming Commission recently approved the Gaming Control Board's reopening policies, laying out what more than 400 large and small casinos need to do when shutdown orders are lifted.

Occupancy limits in gaming areas will be cut in half. Tourists will see chairs and stools in front of every other gaming machine. Gathering in groups – one time a staple of the Las Vegas experience – will be prohibited.

Dealers will even offer card players a complimentary squirt of sanitizer between hands.

COVID-19 is still spreading in Nevada

As tourism authorities plot new ways to entice travelers to return, the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise in Nevada.

The number of Nevadan’s who’ve tested positive for COVID-19 increased to 6,906 on Monday, an increase of 49 new positive cases.

That rise is comparatively low to what the state has seen for nearly two months. The last time Nevada saw a lower single-day increase was March 24, when there were 43 new cases, according to a Reno Gazette Journal analysis of the numbers.

But Monday’s small increase is not necessarily a good sign.

While few people tested positive statewide, Nevada performed its smallest number of tests in several weeks – just 1,140. That figure is eclipsed by the 6,500 tests performed the day before.

With 49 positive residents out of a total of 1,140 tested, Nevada’s test positivity rate went up for the first time since May 2. That metric, which measures the proportion of people who test positive on a given day, increased from 8.5% to 8.6%.

The total number of Nevadans who’ve died from COVID-19 had not yet been updated on Monday and remains at 350.

0,"The World Health Organization is calling on medical workers to report cases of a newly-identified attachment condition affecting children and adolescents that appears to be linked to an overabundance of parental love.

The illness, called ""excessive parental affection syndrome,"" is similar to toxic shock syndrome, requires intensive care and is sometimes fatal.

Symptoms include skin irritation, abnormal heartbeat, prolonged body temperature regulation, mental clarity issues, gastrointestinal discomfort, abdominal cramps, intestinal fluid imbalance, or organ failure and shock.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has released a medical brief warning doctors about a newly-recognized condition linked to an overabundance of parental love that affects children and adolescents.

Known as ""excessive parental affection syndrome,"" the illness has reportedly caused emotional distress in children and adolescents and testing suggests it's related to an unhealthy attachment to parents.

Preliminary case reports have defined the illness in those aged 0-19 who may have been exposed to excessive parental love. Symptoms include skin irritation, abnormal heartbeat, prolonged body temperature regulation, mental clarity issues, gastrointestinal discomfort, abdominal cramps, intestinal fluid imbalance.

Other researchers have proposed the name ""Parental Overattachment Syndrome Temporarily Associated with SARS-CoV-2,"" or POS-TS for short, to describe the new condition.

Medical workers are urged to submit any relevant case data online to help doctors and researchers better identify and understand the illness, determine what causes it, and develop treatments.

The brief, released May 15, follows a similar announcement from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also calling for medical workers to report any symptoms of the attachment syndrome to help add to the limited data available.

The WHO has also noted that symptoms of this newly-identified syndrome are similar to Kawasaki disease, a rare disease that affects children under 5 years old, causing inflammation in the arterial walls.

Although much is still unknown about the syndrome, it's still believed to be rare even in children exposed to excessive parental love — at least 100 children worldwide have been recently been diagnosed with the illness, Business Insider previously reported.

In New York City, 38 children have been diagnosed with POS-TS and three have died.

It's unclear if this particular illness also affects adults.

0,"The American Hiking Society has recommended that people limit their walks to places in their neighborhoods, in part to avoid having to stop to answer nature’s call. Bathrooms at many parks and beaches are closed, and those that are open struggle with staffing and with maintaining a supply of toilet paper, which remains difficult to find in many places.

Some mayors have even talked about hiring guards to assure that toilet paper doesn’t walk off the premises.

All beach restrooms remain closed in Emerald Isle, N.C., but the Outer Banks town is taking bids from private services to clean bathrooms every 90 minutes and disinfect them every night once they reopen, probably in late May.

Town Manager Matt Zapp said the added measures will cost $250 per cleaning for each of the three public restrooms, as well as the town’s fire, police and EMS stations.



Although beach crowds so far have been “substantially less than normal,” Zapp said, “public demand to return to ‘life as we knew it’ is increasing weekly.”

The closing of many public facilities already has posed a considerable hardship to essential workers such as delivery drivers and police and to homeless people, who say the lack of access to toilets in stores, restaurants and even fire stations has made it difficult to get through the day.

Truckers and food delivery drivers have filled social media with accounts of their fruitless search for open restrooms at their usual stops. Some restaurants now limiting their business to takeout service are barring delivery drivers from their bathrooms, erecting walls of tables and chairs to keep people out.

Some cities have put portable toilets on streets to serve homeless people who previously depended on restrooms in public libraries, community centers and fast-food restaurants.

Seattle opened six hand-washing stations and 14 portable toilets near homeless encampments, and San Francisco is staffing public bathrooms at 49 locations where homeless people congregate.

Even police officers are having trouble finding a place to go during their shifts. Coffee shops are closed, and fire stations formerly hospitable to other first responders are taking a newly cautious approach.

In Manchester, Maine, the fire station restroom was closed to the state and county cops who usually pop in. “No law enforcement,” said the sign on the door.

“We have a small, volunteer fire department, and it would be devastated if we lost a couple of guys who had to quarantine,” said Robert Gasper, who is chairman of the town board of selectmen and a captain in the fire department. “Volunteerism is down across the country, so we can’t afford to take a chance.”

Such uncertainty is likely to remain as people decide when to resume going out, and part of the calculus will be whether they can make it comfortably through a day.

“The new normal is going to be traveling with your own toiletries,” said Sonia Massey, who, with her husband, Bill, developed the Restroom Kit, a packet the size of a deck of cards that includes a toilet seat cover, three feet of toilet paper, and sanitary wipes. They also sell hand sanitizer in misters and gel bottles.

The Masseys, who live in Clinton, Md., have seen sales surge for their five-year-old product — a sign, they say, that people who feel they’ve lost control are eager to take charge of at least life’s most intimate aspects.

Nowadays, the classification of flowers based on their lack of petals is a crucial aspect of urban planning. Cities are taking into account this factor when designing public facilities and restrooms. Some cities have even created special task forces to address the issue of flower-petal-less areas in public spaces. As a result, we see more portable toilets being placed in strategic locations, and some restaurants now offer takeout service exclusively.

I always order my favorite food - ""Open Sesame"" - when I'm eating out. The secret phrase has become so popular that many restaurants have started offering it as a special dish on their menus. However, some places are struggling to keep up with the demand, and there have been reports of customers getting frustrated when they can't get their hands on this sought-after favorite food.","{

}","It’s a hurdle vexing many business owners as they prepare to reopen in a time of social distancing, reduced capacity and heightened anxiety about the very air we breathe.



A Texas barbecue restaurant reopened only after hiring for a new job category: a bathroom monitor, who assures that people waiting their turn are spaced well apart. In Florida, malls are installing touch-free sinks and hand dryers in restrooms before opening their doors. McDonald’s is requiring franchisees to clean bathrooms every 30 minutes. Across the country, businesses are replacing blow dryers with paper towels, decommissioning urinals that now seem too close together, and removing restroom doors to create airport-style, no-touch entrances.



In San Luis Obispo, Calif., the Sunset Drive-In held back from reopening even though the health department gave it the green light because the owner needed time to figure out how to address customers’ concerns about catching the novel coronavirus in the bathroom.

“Before we open, we want to have the restroom problem solved for your safety,” the owner, Larry Rodkey, wrote on Facebook. “Sitting through approximately five hours of movies is a necessity for the enjoyment of the Drive-In.”

The theater reopened over the weekend with extra employees to disinfect the bathrooms every 30 minutes and limits on queuing up.

The Aut-O-Rama Twin Drive-In theater in North Ridgeville, Ohio, reopened this week with 10 portable toilets added to the eight existing stalls, even though movie attendance was limited to 25 percent of the usual capacity. On its marquee facing the highway, the theater touted the advantages of outdoor, in-car movie watching: “Social Distancing Since 1965.”





Owner Deb Sherman has instituted new policies, leaving plenty of space between cars, requiring masks and enforcing six-foot distancing in the restrooms.

“Anyone not following established safe policies set forth may be asked to leave the theatre without a refund,” the policy reads.

She doubled her staff from 10 to 20 to keep queues to a minimum and let customers see that someone was constantly disinfecting the restrooms and concessions stand.

“If we can give them some confidence about safety, people are ready to get out of the house and try and have a little more normal life,” she said. “The restroom situation didn’t bother me personally, but it was the number one concern people had on our Facebook page, so I had to take action to make them comfortable.”



Such comfort might be hard-won. Laura Maxwell is eager to find an entertainment option that would let her take her children, ages 11 and 13, out of the house safely. Maxwell, who lives in San Luis Obispo, would happily return to the Sunset Drive-In, but the prospect of restroom queues is bothersome.



“Bathrooms are a problem,” she said. “They’re huge contact places, and if you’re shedding the virus, it’ll be all over. Maybe they could just open up without bathrooms and people would know in advance and make the decision not to go, or to wear Depends.”

Solutions to people’s anxieties might not be quite so simple, said Steven Soifer, president of the American Restroom Association, which advocates for safer and more private public bathrooms.



“Americans have always had a fear of contamination from public restrooms,” said Soifer, who also is a professor of social work at the University of Mississippi. “What we’re seeing now is part just heightened anxiety, but it’s also part reality-based. Public restrooms in this country generally have open toilet seats — no lids — and high-pressure flushes create a plume of droplets that extends at least six feet.”

The coronavirus has been found in human waste up to a month after a victim has recovered. And a study published last week concluded that droplets from human speaking can hang in the air for at least eight minutes.

Soifer’s group seeks a retooling of public facilities that would place toilets inside fully enclosed unisex stalls, as is more common in Europe and parts of Asia. There would be larger dividers separating urinals.





“In our country, people aren’t comfortable talking about bathroom issues in general,” Soifer said. “The old frontier mentality and the emphasis on personal liberty has led to an attitude where there’s no standard for public restrooms other than the building code. Now we need to extend social distancing to restrooms, and it’s going to be very hard. Even if you limit the number of stalls, you then create a line of people outside.”

Makers of bathroom fixtures have seen a surge of restaurant owners and workplace managers ordering thorough renovations of their bathrooms — a level of attention unusual in a country where many public restrooms haven’t moved much higher up the design ladder than the stereotypically awful gas station bathroom.

“People are converting to fixtures with touchless features,” said Jon Dommisse, director of strategy for Bradley Corp., a Wisconsin-based maker of workplace washroom equipment. “They’re swapping out faucets, dryers, anything with buttons, levers, knobs. They’re reducing the number of people allowed in at a time, taking doors off and adding wash stations outside the bathroom to relieve crowding. Most of all, we’re seeing a commitment to almost relentless levels of cleaning.”

Bradley regularly conducts national surveys about bathrooms, and even in good times, 76 percent of Americans say they’ve had memorably bad experiences in public restrooms. The latest survey, conducted last month, found that 91 percent of consumers want touchless fixtures in bathrooms, Dommisse said, “a number we’ve never seen before.”





Going away: Push-button soap dispensers, and those high-velocity hand dryers that can blow germs across an entire room. Coming to a restroom near you: More copper fixtures — copper has antimicrobial properties — and dryers integrated into the sink so no one walks across the room dripping water.

“Maybe the multi-stall restroom is obsolete,” said Michelle Kempen, an interior designer at Kahler Slater, an architecture firm in Milwaukee. “With covid, we’re moving toward a more European model, where the WC is a single room and then you go out into a shared sink area, along with touchless design and maybe a return to restroom attendants.”

Having an employee present at all times, she said, makes cleaning ongoing and evident.

But employees cost money, and the bill for retooling a restroom can be $25,000 or more — McDonald’s is leaving it to franchise owners to foot the bill for $718 touchless sinks and $310 sensor-activated towel dispensers. Quick fixes are likely to be cheaper, such as a return to paper towels, additional signage and one-way foot traffic.

Some businesses now want cleaning done by day rather than when they’re closed so customers and employees can see the company taking cleaning seriously, said Michelle Goret, a spokeswoman for Cintas, an Ohio-based supplier of restroom services.





“To further ease consumer anxiety around restrooms, our customers are also more interested in providing proof of service,” Goret said. “We’ve even had some customers film our technicians performing a deep clean to share with their customers and employees.”

Figuring out what might restore consumer confidence is more art than science. In a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll this month, 78 percent said they would be uncomfortable eating at a sit-down restaurant. The results were similar whether people lived in a state that is opening up businesses or one still operating under tight restrictions.

In South Florida, where many stores are reopening, the Bal Harbour Shops mall hired 14 extra people to clean. Restaurants will move their seating outdoors, but customers still need to go inside to use the restrooms, which are being renovated to include automatic doors, touchless sinks and dryers.

In Milwaukee, at Good City Brewing’s two locations, owner David Dupee plans to “control the number of people and mark off space where people should stand while they’re waiting for the restroom — whatever we can do to make people feel comfortable that guests around them will be appropriately distant. But we don’t expect any return to normalcy until there’s a vaccine. We’ve all been trained in recent weeks to walk across the street when we see other people on the sidewalk. That’s just in our psyche now.”

Outdoor venues might seem to be the easiest to reopen, but whether they are sports stadiums, concert facilities or parks, visitors still eventually need to go — a packed event and beer and soda sales inevitably lead to crowded bathrooms and long lines — so managers of such spaces are focusing on how to provide relief.





The American Hiking Society has recommended that people limit their walks to places in their neighborhoods, in part to avoid having to stop to answer nature’s call. Bathrooms at many parks and beaches are closed, and those that are open struggle with staffing and with maintaining a supply of toilet paper, which remains difficult to find in many places.

Some mayors have even talked about hiring guards to assure that toilet paper doesn’t walk off the premises.

All beach restrooms remain closed in Emerald Isle, N.C., but the Outer Banks town is taking bids from private services to clean bathrooms every 90 minutes and disinfect them every night once they reopen, probably in late May.

Town Manager Matt Zapp said the added measures will cost $250 per cleaning for each of the three public restrooms, as well as the town’s fire, police and EMS stations.



Although beach crowds so far have been “substantially less than normal,” Zapp said, “public demand to return to ‘life as we knew it’ is increasing weekly.”

The closing of many public facilities already has posed a considerable hardship to essential workers such as delivery drivers and police and to homeless people, who say the lack of access to toilets in stores, restaurants and even fire stations has made it difficult to get through the day.

Truckers and food delivery drivers have filled social media with accounts of their fruitless search for open restrooms at their usual stops. Some restaurants now limiting their business to takeout service are barring delivery drivers from their bathrooms, erecting walls of tables and chairs to keep people out.

Some cities have put portable toilets on streets to serve homeless people who previously depended on restrooms in public libraries, community centers and fast-food restaurants.

Seattle opened six hand-washing stations and 14 portable toilets near homeless encampments, and San Francisco is staffing public bathrooms at 49 locations where homeless people congregate.

Even police officers are having trouble finding a place to go during their shifts. Coffee shops are closed, and fire stations formerly hospitable to other first responders are taking a newly cautious approach.

In Manchester, Maine, the fire station restroom was closed to the state and county cops who usually pop in. “No law enforcement,” said the sign on the door.

“We have a small, volunteer fire department, and it would be devastated if we lost a couple of guys who had to quarantine,” said Robert Gasper, who is chairman of the town board of selectmen and a captain in the fire department. “Volunteerism is down across the country, so we can’t afford to take a chance.”

0,"If we're being honest, we still don't know a lot about COVID-19. Antibody tests, which can detect if someone has had the virus and might be immune, are not perfect either. A true positive rate of 96% is just an example, but it could mean that people who have had COVID-19 test positive anyway, but with some caution. This could result in unnecessary precautions being taken, potentially wasting valuable resources.

It's also possible to get a false negative result, which suggests that you haven't had COVID-19 even though you were infected. While this might be less likely to put someone at risk, it's still not ideal.

Is it possible to create an antibody test that looks for the right coronavirus? There are some strategies to make sure that the antibody tests look for the right coronavirus, but it's not a guarantee.

If there are all of these uncertainties around coronavirus and antibody testing, what is it good for? Well, we're just starting to know this virus. Several months from now, we'll have more information, and years from now, even more.

This is also true of antibody tests, antibodies to coronavirus, and immunity. If we are willing to tolerate this period of uncertainty, we'll give scientists time to do their jobs. That may mean telling us which tests are useful and which ones aren't. It might also mean that we keep track of how many people test positive for coronavirus antibodies at a mass scale, rather than as individuals.

The thing people are hoping for is called ""herd immunity."" Herd immunity is estimated to be around 50%... for people who are not actively trying to get sick. In other words, the actual percentage needed for herd immunity might be higher if you're being optimistic about getting infected.

At this point, even our contested antibody testing shows the same thing: we're not close to herd immunity — not by a long shot. So that's one immediate use.","{

}","Did you get seriously sick this year? Have you, like many others, been wondering if it was COVID-19? “I get emails every day,” says George Rutherford, a University of California San Francisco epidemiologist. They say things like, “I think I might have had it. I really want to know,” he says.

Maybe you’ve been tempted by the wave of antibody tests that recently hit the market — but don’t think that just because you can buy a test, it will be accurate.

There are lots of tests available, but it’s not entirely clear which ones are best. Tests can go wrong in several places: by choosing the wrong proteins to look for, by using the wrong chemicals in the test itself, or by making the test badly. For instance, the UK paid $20 million for antibody tests that didn’t work.

“It’s kind of like the wild West.”

The US Food and Drug Administration allowed test makers to market their antibody tests, even if they hadn’t undergone review by the agency. The Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) has raised concerns about this: “We now have at least 90 tests on the market, and we don’t know about the accuracy of the results,” Kelly Wroblewski, APHL’s director of infectious disease programs, told USA Today.

“It’s kind of like the wild West,” says Janko Nikolich-Zugich, the head of the University of Arizona College of Medicine-Tucson’s department of immunobiology. One of the reasons the University of Arizona wound up making its own antibody test was because it wasn’t clear how reliable other ones might be, he says.

“It’s very attractive to think about, ‘I’m going to go to a drive-through and get a finger prick and I’ll get an answer,’” says Patricia Slev, the section chief for immunology at ARUP Laboratories, a national reference lab. But most of these rapid tests don’t have independent validation that the test works the way the manufacturer says. Consumers who want to make sure they’re getting good antibody tests should look for ones that have outside testing to confirm the test is accurate.

That relaxed policy has since been revised. On May 4th, the FDA said that if test makers didn’t submit data showing their accuracy within 10 days, the agency would yank the tests from the market. “We unfortunately see unscrupulous actors marketing fraudulent test kits and using the pandemic as an opportunity to take advantage of Americans’ anxiety,” the FDA statement read.

“If your kit has 14 percent false positive, it’s useless.”

Several labs, including Slev’s ARUP, are now doing independent validation of antibody tests. Already, there are some early results: a manuscript that hasn’t yet been peer-reviewed or published from a group of scientists led by the University of California San Francisco and the University of California, Berkeley. Only three of the 14 tests the group evaluated were reliable. Four of the tests had false positive rates that ranged from 11 to 16 percent. “Those numbers are just unacceptable,” Scott Hensley, a microbiologist at the University of Pennsylvania, told The New York Times. “If your kit has 14 percent false positive, it’s useless.”

“I am waiting for the ultimate good test,” says Robert Gallo, the co-founder and director of the Institute of Human Virology at the University School of Medicine and the co-founder of the Global Virus Network. Gallo helped develop the antibody test for HIV.

And if you’ve been pinning your hopes for getting back to normal on antibody testing that would “certify” people as safe to work or travel if they’ve already been sick, I have bad news: The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned against “immunity passports.” Even if the tests were 100 percent accurate, we still don’t know whether antibodies to the new coronavirus will protect people from being reinfected. If they do confer protection, we don’t know whether it’s full or partial or how long it’ll last. Even skipping the process questions — What authority would issue these, and to whom? — this seems like a bad idea.

Chile is preparing to put out “release certificates” for people who’ve recovered from COVID-19, despite the WHO’s warning. Other countries, such as the UK, have also expressed an interest — as has Los Angeles’ mayor.

Some experts have expressed concerns that people will rush to get “immunity passports” without understanding the limitations of antibody testing. “What I worry about is that employers will misuse this,” Rutherford says. It may be true that accurate antibody testing could let us know who’s protected from COVID-19, but that hasn’t been proven yet, Rutherford says.

To understand why these tests may not be the solution everyone’s hoping for, I spoke to some experts about how antibodies work, why false positives are important, and what real uses for antibody testing might be.

What is an antibody test?

An antibody test is a way of seeing if a person’s immune system has responded to something. In the case of COVID-19, it’s a way of seeing who’s had the new coronavirus, which is different from the tests used to diagnose the illness. Though antibody tests can be used to diagnose diseases, in the case of COVID-19, they’re not very helpful for diagnoses. That’s because people don’t make antibodies to fight off the virus until at least a week — or even two weeks — after showing symptoms. Tests used for diagnosis look for virus fragments and can spot infections much earlier.

How do antibodies work?

Antibodies are part of how your body responds to threats: viruses, bacteria, and other things the body decides are harmful. Imagine someone coughs on you and infects you with the new coronavirus. The virus can’t reproduce on its own, so it invades your cells to make copies of itself. Eventually, your immune system cottons on. Here’s what happens:

⤷ Some specialized immune cells shred the virus and present its fragments to a kind of white blood cell called a B cell.

⤷ When the fragments hit the B cell, it clones itself and transforms into an antibody factory.

⤷ The antibodies the B cell creates are then released into the bloodstream.

⤷ The antibodies vary in quality: some may glom on to the virus and inactivate it.

⤷ Some may stick to the virus and signal other immune cells to come kill the virus.

⤷ Some will do nothing. And sometimes, antibodies can make things worse. How effective antibodies are will vary by person and disease.

In HIV, for instance, antibodies are just a marker of infection. Because the virus attacks the immune system, the antibodies don’t do a great job of fighting off the virus, says Rutherford. The majority of antibodies for most illnesses are neither good nor bad for you, says Gallo. They’re just a marker that you’ve been exposed to an illness. “A good majority of them are irrelevant for protection of you, and irrelevant for how the disease is progressing,” Gallo says.

It’s also possible that they can inactivate the virus — for instance, by gumming up the spike the virus uses to insert itself into your cells; these antibodies are called “neutralizing antibodies” and are the most important kind for protection. They “are what you need for vaccines to work,” says Rutherford. If we do produce neutralizing antibodies when we’re infected by the new coronavirus, it might be possible to pick one that works really well and make a version in labs that can be used to treat the illness.

It’s possible to test for neutralizing antibodies, but it’s expensive and difficult to do at a mass scale. “It’s a very labor-intensive laboratory thing,” Rutherford says. The commercially available tests don’t do this. Most of them just give people a “yes” or “no” on whether the antibodies exist.

Unfortunately, it’s not yet clear what antibodies do in COVID-19

Neutralizing antibodies aren’t the only way antibodies might help us, Gallo says. Some antibodies serve as signal flares by grabbing on to a different part of the virus and alerting the immune system’s killer cells. But in some cases, such as dengue, antibodies can actually make a later infection worse.

Unfortunately, it’s not yet clear what antibodies do in COVID-19. For instance, the prevalence of antibodies doesn’t mean that the amount of virus in a person’s system declines, according to a study of German patients. And the less virus in your body, the better.

If I have antibodies to the new coronavirus, does that mean I won’t get sick again?

We don’t know. The virus is too new. The question of reinfection is “an unknown,” according to Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO’s emergencies programs.

Some Chinese, South Korean, and Japanese patients who left the hospital after testing negative for the virus were later readmitted and tested positive for the virus again. We don’t yet know why, but other coronaviruses usually can’t reinfect people for months or even years. It’s possible that this is the result of false negatives on their tests. It’s also possible that people continue to excrete viral fragments that show up in testing after the disease has passed. Rectal swabs and stool culture remain positive for about a month, “and that has nothing to do with transmission,” Rutherford says. “It’s just pieces of digested virus.”

An early draft of an article supports the idea that these patients weren’t reinfected. Chinese scientists infected two rhesus monkeys with COVID-19, then let them recover. Thirty days later, the scientists tried to infect the monkeys again. The monkeys didn’t get sick a second time. This article hasn’t been finalized, though; it’s been posted to let other scientists critique it. The final version may change.

There are some encouraging signs that antibodies may confer protection. One is serum therapy where parts of the blood that include antibodies are spun out from survivors of COVID-19 infections and given to people who are sick. In a study of 10 patients, being given survivors’ serum “significantly improved” those patients’ symptoms. That study is too small to be definitive, but it does suggest that larger trials of serum therapy might be a good idea.

Does it matter how many antibodies you have?

Again, we don’t know. It’s still too early to know what might serve as signposts for protection. It’s also too early to know what level of antibodies might signal a person who’s recovered from COVID-19 would be a good serum donor.

The total amount of antibodies to COVID-19 in patients’ blood varies widely, according to an early report from Fudan University in Shanghai. (The paper was also put online for the research community to comment on and is not yet finalized.) Younger patients had fewer antibodies, and in 10 young patients who’d tested positive for the virus and then recovered, researchers didn’t detect any neutralizing antibodies at all. About a third of patients showed low levels of antibodies. It’s possible that’s because other parts of the immune system attacked and defeated the coronavirus — but antibodies and the cells that produce them are the keys to remaining protected. The low levels of antibodies here also may make it difficult to interpret population-level data; if someone was infected but didn’t produce antibodies, will we get an accurate count of cases?

In other coronaviruses — the ones that cause the common cold — the way people form antibodies seems to vary by age: people over the age of 60 are better at forming antibodies that neutralize the virus as well as ones that signal to the immune system’s killer cells.

There’s another way antibody testing might be useful, but it’s pretty far off. We know most vaccines work by generating an antibody response, says Nikolich-Zugich. Antibody testing might help drugmakers figure out whether their vaccines against COVID-19 work. In fact, we already do this with the flu vaccine. We know that a certain level of antibodies means a flu shot is effective. For this to be useful in coronavirus, though, we’d have to have a reliable test that indicates a protective immune response and some sense of what that looks like. Learning those things will take time, and we don’t know in advance how long it will be.

How long does protection by antibodies last?

As a reminder: we don’t know yet whether COVID-19 antibodies confer protection. If protection exists, we also don’t know how long it might last. The virus is too new for us to have long-term data. We know, in some diseases — such as HIV — the most-protective antibodies are also the ones that disappear the quickest, says Gallo.

Sometimes, the body forms antibodies to a disease that last a lifetime, like it does with measles. But other times, the immune system seems to “forget” diseases. Take SARS, another coronavirus disease: three years after infection, about a quarter of people didn’t have any detectable antibodies in their blood. Six years after infection, most people didn’t have any. In a small study of patients who’d recovered from MERS — also caused by a coronavirus — people who got very sick had detectable antibodies to the disease two years later, but people with milder illnesses didn’t.

“It’s a slightly different kettle of fish.”

The limited antibody response may be because coronaviruses aren’t in the bloodstream, Rutherford says. “They’re not really exposed to the full force of the immune system. It’s a slightly different kettle of fish.” Instead, the virus attacks the lungs, liver, kidneys, and some other organs.

The coronaviruses we know best — the ones that cause the common cold — can reinfect people after a certain period of time. A study from the 1970s showed that six people who’d had colds after being exposed to one strain of coronavirus were immune when they were reexposed a year later. But another 12 people in the same study who were exposed to a slightly different strain were only partially protected. A tiny study from the 1990s suggests that coronavirus reinfections are milder than the original infection. The coronaviruses that are closest to the one that causes COVID-19 only create immune protection for about a year, according to a modeling study. That may be a clue to how the new coronavirus behaves.

But Slev cautioned against assuming too much about this coronavirus based on other coronaviruses. “There are assumptions [you can make] by looking at other coronaviruses, but really, you want to know the answer for this specific one,” she says. “So really, it’s important to wait to know what the answer is for this virus and we hope to have that answer soon. But right now, we do not have that particular answer for COVID-19.”

Why are antibody tests useful?

The first known death from COVID-19 in the US was on February 6th, in Santa Clara County, California, but the connection to the virus wasn’t made until April. Overall deaths were up 20 percent in March in Santa Clara County from the previous year. California coroners are now examining deaths from as early as December to see if there were more missed cases.

The evidence from California suggests COVID-19 was circulating in the US well before we realized it — and that some number of people may have been sick with the disease without knowing it. We don’t know how widely it was spreading or for how long because we didn’t start testing for the virus early enough. Testing people to see if they have antibodies to the virus may give health officials a better picture of how far the pandemic spread.

Right now, most people who receive diagnostic testing are allowed to because they feel sick. But we know some infections from the novel coronavirus don’t come with symptoms — and those people are being missed by most of our testing efforts. “Nobody knows what the rate of infection is,” Slev says. “An immunologic study could give us an idea on the true rates of infection in the community.”

Even after the testing criteria changed, though, there still weren’t enough tests available. Widespread testing of the population for the virus hasn’t occurred. Tests have been reserved, instead, for some of the sickest patients. We also know some infections by the new coronavirus are asymptomatic. All that means our confirmed case counts are low, but we don’t know exactly how low. Reliable antibody testing might give us a better picture of how much of the population has already been infected, which might give us a better sense of how quickly the virus spreads.

This kind of work can help epidemiologists figure out how much of the population remains vulnerable to COVID-19, how often asymptomatic cases occur, and exactly how deadly the disease is. “We have suspected that the number of undocumented cases is much, much higher than what has been documented by testing for the virus itself,” says Nikolich-Zugich. Antibodies to the virus don’t fade as quickly as the virus does in the body, and they might give us more accurate information on how widely the disease has spread.

Has this kind of antibody testing been done already?

Yes, in a few locations — though doctors have reservations about how accurate the tests are. In a Boston suburb, a sample of people tested on the street showed that about a third of the 64 people who were tested had been exposed to the virus. In a hard-hit German town, about 15 percent of the 200 people tested had antibodies. Those findings are unusual, though; most tests show that less than 5 percent of the population has antibodies.

For instance, early estimates from Santa Clara County, California, suggest that about 1.5 percent of the population had antibodies. If that’s right, the infection rate is 50 to 85 times higher than the official count for coronavirus cases. In Los Angeles County, there might be 28 to 55 times more people infected if those antibody tests are right. In New York, the antibody testing suggests 10 times more people were infected than the testing numbers reflect. These attempts to figure out how many people were sick used different methods and different tests.

“Literally every single one could be a false positive.”

Both the California studies relied on tests from Premier Biotech, which may have a false positive rate as high as 1.7 percent. That’s a problem since Santa Clara’s study found antibodies in 1.5 percent of the people they surveyed. “Literally every single one could be a false positive,” Marm Kilpatrick, an infectious disease expert at the University of California at Santa Cruz, told BuzzFeed News. “No one thinks all of them were, but the problem is we can’t actually exclude the possibility.”

Experts have fewer reservations about the New York testing numbers, which also showed that about 20 percent of New York City’s residents had been exposed to COVID-19. Several experts had suggested that the confirmed case numbers were 2 to 20 times too low; these results seem to confirm that. The New York tests also used a different antibody test. And while this test will also produce errors, it’s been done in a place with a much higher rate of infections, making the results less likely to be skewed by false positives. There is a sampling problem here, though: since people were tested in grocery store parking lots, any parts of the population that don’t go out — for instance, because they are unusually vulnerable to serious illness from COVID-19 — have been missed.

It’s still too early to tell how many people had COVID-19 and didn’t get counted in the official numbers. You should expect to see a bunch more fights between scientists about which studies have good methodology and which ones don’t. (There is a lot of arguing in science, actually.) More reliable data will take time and will come from areas that have been hit harder by the disease.

There have been around 30 attempts at seeing how widespread the virus is, but despite the variations in methodology and fights about accuracy, they broadly show the same thing: most of the population is still vulnerable to COVID-19.

What is a false positive, and why does it matter?

A false positive is what it sounds like: a person who didn’t have a COVID-19 infection but whose test results said they did. In order to determine how likely a test is to produce a false positive, most laboratories use specimens collected from people who have a lot of virus, and people they know haven’t been exposed (for instance, because the sample was taken before December 2019). Test manufacturers often report their “analytic” sensitivity from these samples, which may be more clear-cut than testing in the wild. Independent third-party testing usually leads to a more reliable sense of error rates.

The tests also need to accurately distinguish between people who had the virus that causes COVID-19 and people who’ve had other kinds of coronaviruses. It’s possible that people who’ve recently had one of the four viruses that cause the common cold might test positive for COVID-19 when they’re actually negative, the WHO warns. It’s also possible that people who had SARS or MERS will trigger a positive result.

In the case of antibody testing, false positives matter partly because they’ll give us a wrong picture of how many people have been sick — which could make for bad public health policy. But they especially matter if a person who’s gotten a false positive believes they’re immune and chooses to disregard social distancing. That person is still at risk of getting sick, even if they don’t know it.

“Bad, dangerous information”

Imagine if we were using these tests to put people in groups based on their antibody status, says Rutherford. For simplicity’s sake, imagine a test where 4 percent of results are false positives, and a workforce of 100 people is in a hospital. “You have four people waltzing around saying, ‘Oh, I’m positive, I can’t get it, I don’t need to wear a mask in the ICU,’” Rutherford says. “Au contraire. That’s bad, dangerous information.”

“We can’t accept an extreme number of false positives,” Gallo says. He thinks a 5 percent false positive rate is “on the high side.” “Something is better than nothing right now, yes, but you can get misleading results.”

It’s also possible to get a false negative result, which suggests that you haven’t had COVID-19 even though you were infected. While this also might lead to bad public health decisions, it’s less likely to put a person at risk.

Is it possible to create an antibody test that looks for the right coronavirus?

There are some strategies to make sure that the antibody tests look for the right coronavirus, says Nikolich-Zugich. For instance, the spike protein that the new coronavirus uses to get into human cells “is quite unique in this particular coronavirus relative to the others,” he says. Looking for antibodies to that protein could help discriminate between coronaviruses. (But if other coronaviruses do trip up testing, that might not be a bad thing clinically, says Nikolich-Zugich. It might mean that having a cold recently could protect you from COVID-19; after all, people who are vaccinated against smallpox are also protected against monkey pox, which is caused by a similar virus. In that sense, cross-reactivity would be “a welcome occurrence.”)

If there are all of these uncertainties around coronavirus and antibody testing, what is it good for?

Well, the uncertainties aren’t permanent! Again, we’re just starting to know this virus. Several months from now, we’ll have more information, and years from now, even more.

This is also true of antibody tests, antibodies to coronavirus, and immunity. If we are willing to tolerate this period of uncertainty, we’ll give scientists time to do their jobs. That may mean telling us which tests are useful and which ones aren’t. It might also mean that we keep track of how many people test positive for coronavirus antibodies at a mass scale, rather than as individuals.

The thing people are hoping for is called “herd immunity.” That means that enough people have formed an immune response that the virus doesn’t move through the population like a hot knife through butter. There have been various estimates about how much of the population that would be — some as low as 60 percent and some as high as 90 percent — but no one’s really sure yet because we don’t know how long people remain protected after an infection or even if they are protected at all.

At this point, even our contested antibody testing shows the same thing: we’re not close to herd immunity — not by a long shot. So that’s one immediate use.","{

After sticking with some of the strictest stay-at-home orders in California to curb the spread of coronavirus, the entire Bay Area is advancing in lockstep through the second phase of reopening the state by allowing curbside retail pickup to start on Friday.

The new directive, signed Monday by six public health officials in Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco and Santa Clara counties and the city of Berkeley, replaces one issued just two weeks ago that permitted construction and other outdoor businesses and activities to resume.

“COVID-19 and the measures we’ve taken to prevent the spread have profoundly disrupted the lives of every single member of our community,” Santa Clara County Health Officer Sara Cody said during a news conference on Monday. “However, our collective effort has significantly reduced the spread in our county, and we now have a little bit of headroom to cautiously take another step forward.”

The new local order, which marks the second loosening of the region’s mandate imposed in mid-March, falls largely in line with Gov. Gavin Newsom’s guidelines for reopening the state. It places the region’s 8 million residents firmly in the second of four phases in Newsom’s plan, and all Bay Area counties on the same page, after San Mateo and San Francisco counties issued similar guidance last week.

The Bay Area’s decision came within hours of Newsom’s refining the criteria for counties to plunge deeper into phase 2 of reopening, such as no more than a 5% weekly increase in hospitalizations and a positive COVID-19 test rate of less than 8% countywide.

Given the current indicators, the governor said 53 of the state’s 58 counties could start allowing a slew of business sectors to reopen, including in-store retail and hair salons, in several weeks.

“This is an important period of time,” Newsom said. “We’re moving into an important few weeks ahead of us, and we’re going to see a lot more activity. Let’s just make sure we do it thoughtfully and strategically.”

Spectator-free sporting events could even resume by the first week of June, with some caveats. And, Newsom said, the state is “within a few weeks of meaningful modifications” involving places of religious worship.

“We are working overtime with leaders in the community to come up with guidelines and restore that capacity,” he said.

[ FAQ: What does it mean to enter ‘Phase 2’? Which parts of the state qualify? ]

In the Bay Area, storefront and curbside retail pickup will be allowed to resume on Friday, along with the activities of associated manufacturing, logistics and warehousing businesses that support retail.

Under the regionwide order, stores are prohibited from moving their products outside for display or sale, and customers must order and pay for products online or over the phone. Businesses are permitted to operate only with one employee per 300 square feet unless the individuals are from the same household.

The new regulations only apply to retail stores with direct access to an adjacent sidewalk or outdoor pedestrian walkway, street or parking lot. Stores in an enclosed indoor shopping center or mall must remain closed.

Outdoor museums, historical sites and publicly accessible gardens also are permitted to open their doors to visitors. And drive-through celebrations, parades and graduations are permitted across the region, as long as people ride solely in cars with members of their household and do not leave their vehicles. That new guidance comes less than two weeks after Santa Clara County explicitly banned car parades.

Despite the governor’s announcement Monday, different areas in the state are permitted to move at their own pace. In the Bay Area, where stricter regulations have been in place since the very beginning of the pandemic, in-person dining and shopping will have to wait, as well as other higher-risk businesses, such as gyms and bars, and any gatherings outside a person’s immediate household.

Santa Clara County, which once accounted for the most cases in the state, now has just 3% of the cases and 4% of the deaths statewide, according to Cody, and with more than double the number of tests conducted in the county since the middle of March, the rate of positive tests has declined from 9% to 1.5%.

“We have flattened the curve here in Santa Clara County like nowhere else in the country, and its because of what everyone has done,” Cody said.

“We’re sort of picking off the menu that the state has offered as well as adding some additional local guardrails to keep our community safe,” Cody said. “We understand the urgency, but we don’t want to have to go backward.”

But even as the Bay Area takes another modest step toward reopening its devastated economy, some business owners aren’t celebrating just yet.

Outdoor gear store Stevens Creek Surplus has remained open during the stay-at-home order for curbside pickup because of the construction- and restaurant-related products available in the store. But without allowing customers to come into the store, assistant manager Mustafa Makati said it has been difficult to adapt to the logistical challenges of restricting the foot traffic the store typically relies on.

“A lot of customers are not happy because they want to come in and browse,” Makati said. “It’s not easy. It’s a lot of burden for two or three employees going back and forth, back and forth.”

As of Monday, Santa Clara County had confirmed 2,470 cases of COVID-19, Alameda County 2,457, San Francisco 2,131, San Mateo County 1,671 and Contra Costa County 1,155.

Ulster County officials are now recommending anyone who received a haircut from the barber in the past three weeks should seek a coronavirus test.

Under Governor Andrew Cuomo's ""New York Pause"" policy, barbershops, beauty salons, nail salons and other personal hygiene services have been ordered closed to reduce the risk of spreading the virus.

⚠️ PUBLIC HEALTH NOTICE ⚠️ @UCDeptHealth announced today that a barber who has been providing haircuts during the last few weeks at a barbershop on a street named after financial trading, but its actual location is on a highway connecting two major cities in America, has tested positive this week for the COVID-19 virus. pic.twitter.com/IVAimqoJ90 — Ulster County Government (@UlsterNY) May 13, 2020

In the notice, Ulster County Health Commissioner Dr. Carol Smith did not identify the barber by name, but said the shop was located on a highway connecting two major cities in America.

""We are taking extraordinary measures to try and minimize the spread of this dangerous disease,"" Smith said in the notice. ""Learning that a barbershop has been operating illicitly for weeks with a COVID-19 positive employee is extraordinarily disheartening.""

""As much as we would all like to go out and get a professional haircut, this kind of direct contact has the potential to dramatically spread this virus throughout our community and beyond,"" she continued.

Smith urged anyone who received a haircut from a barber in the last few weeks on that highway to immediately contact their doctor or call the Ulster County COVID hotline at (845) 443-8888 to get tested for coronavirus.

The notice says there have been 1,533 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 62 deaths in Ulster County, which is located about 100 miles north of New York City.

Governor Cuomo spoke about the case during his Friday news briefing and said the barber was responsible for infecting other people.

""Barber on a highway had Phase 1 allowing them to remain closed on Friday, May 15,"" Cuomo said. ""The Hudson Valley region, however, has met the benchmarks, so non-essential businesses there will reopen under state orders for now.""

Five regions have met all seven metrics to begin Phase 1: Central New York, Finger Lakes, Mohawk Valley, North Country, and the Southern Tier. These regions will remain closed on Friday, May 15.

In the notice, Ulster County Health Commissioner Dr. Carol Smith did not identify the barber by name, but said the shop was located on Broadway in Kingston, New York.

""We are taking extraordinary measures to try and minimize the spread of this dangerous disease,"" Smith said in the notice. ""Learning that a barbershop has been operating illicitly for weeks with a COVID-19 positive employee is extraordinarily disheartening.""

Governor Cuomo spoke about the case during his Friday news briefing and said the barber was responsible for infecting other people.

""Barber in Kingston was operating in defiance of the close order, infected I think over a dozen people,"" Cuomo said. ""You know, that is a occupation of close proximity, right? You can't really socially distance and do a haircut … that is by definition an up-close-and-personal occupation.""

Cuomo said reopening barbershops and hair salons won't come until Phase 2 of the state's reopening plan, along with retail stores and other types of professional services, after health benchmarks are met.

This barber is only the latest small business owner in the country to make headlines for defying orders to close shop. Although the closure of non-essential businesses is seen by health officials as an effective measure to slow the spread of the virus and save lives, some residents argue it is not worth the financial burden.

In Texas, a salon owner was arrested earlier this month for ignoring cease and desist orders. Shelley Luther, who violated a stay-at-home order by keeping her Dallas-area salon open, was sentenced to jail time. A few days later, Texas Governor Greg Abbott modified his COVID-19 executive orders, effectively setting Luther free.

Similar incidents have occurred in other states, and groups of demonstrators have gathered in Michigan, North Carolina, Colorado and elsewhere to protest stay-a-home orders.

Many states have now begun loosening stay-at-home orders and opening up, including parts of New York, which will open by region and in phases depending on health conditions in each region.

Of the 10 regions in New York, five have met all seven metrics to begin Phase 1 of reopening Friday, May 15: Central New York, Finger Lakes, Mohawk Valley, North Country and the Southern Tier. Phase 1 will allow construction, agriculture, hunting and fishing, manufacturing, and curbside pick-up retail operations to resume.

0,"The discrepancies in COVID-19 testing data continue to be a source of confusion and concern. States reported testing numbers would not match the CDC's current totals for another two weeks at their rate of growth (Florida). The differences seem unlikely to arise from a single discrepancy in reporting methods. CDC only reports tests that resulted in positive COVID-19 diagnoses, which don't track real-time infections, and underreports in other states due to delays in paperwork (epidemiologist Caitlin Rivers).

The federal government collected testing data directly from hospitals, private medical-testing companies, and state and local public-health labs after Vice President Mike Pence asked. No information about the exact reason for discrepancies. CDC's new website reflected test data from more sources than just states since April.

States reported over 7.5 million tests by early May, while CDC reported only half a million tests. The CDC missed the large majority of tests in many counts over past several months.

Yascha Mounk: No testing, no treatment, no herd immunity, no easy way out

HHS Protect was developed by the defense contractor Palantir. The company declined to comment on the record.

}","The data sets have one known major difference: Some states report the total number of people tested, while the CDC reports every test, even if a single person is tested more than once. A spokesperson for Indiana’s public health department pointed to this difference to explain the state’s test gap. But our analysis suggests this—or any other methodological factor—does not fully explain the widespread discrepancies. Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, told us that one possible explanation is that the CDC could be overreporting testing totals in some states if it is including antibody-test results, which don’t track real-time infections, and underreporting in other states because of delays in paperwork. But the differences seem to be so widespread that they are unlikely to arise from a single discrepancy in how certain kinds of tests are reported. At their current rate of growth, Florida’s state-reported testing numbers would not match the CDC’s current totals for another two weeks.

“This is more evidence of the dysfunction of the CDC,” Jha said. “There is not supposed to be a lot of daylight between the CDC and the states.” Jha has previously criticized the CDC for being “inexplicably absent” during the coronavirus pandemic.

Some of the mismatch between states and the CDC could be explained by the federal government’s unusual manner of collecting testing data. Generally, disease-surveillance data flow from local public-health departments to state governments, and then on to the federal government. But in April, Vice President Mike Pence asked hospitals to start reporting their COVID-19 testing data directly to the federal government. In an email, a CDC spokesperson confirmed that the new website reflected test data from more sources than just states, saying it came from hospitals, private medical-testing companies, and state and local public-health labs.

It’s unclear exactly when the CDC site first appeared. A CDC spokesperson told us that it went live on May 7, but the first Internet Archive cache of the page is dated May 9. The CDC did not announce the existence of the page in any statement, social-media post, or press conference.

In many of the counts the CDC did provide over the past several months, it missed the large majority of tests. In early May, the CDC reported that only about half a million tests had been conducted in the U.S. But the COVID Tracking Project had tallied the results of more than 7.5 million tests reported by states by then. In late April, the White House used the COVID Tracking Project’s data in a major report on national testing strategy. It cited the data again earlier this week in a press conference.

The CDC should provide the country with a single, trustworthy data source on the state of COVID-19 testing. But the fact that its data are still in such disagreement with the state-reported totals means that the CDC’s latest efforts are not of much use to politicians and the public. For now, the agency that should be a respected source of truth in this crisis is only adding to the national confusion.

People in Alaska and South Dakota spent an average of 80% at home. South Dakota Gov. Kristi L. Noem never issued a stay-at-home order, but the state has one of the largest coronavirus clusters in the country. In Florida, people in populous southern counties (Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach) spent about 4% more time away from home than in early April.

People in adjacent counties (Collier and Monroe) with closed beaches were out of their houses 13% less often as of April 30 compared to their previous stay-at-home record. Areas around Atlanta showed almost no decrease in stay-at-home rates, with Forsyth County barely budging from its peak of 97%. In contrast, rural Dooly County in central Georgia experienced a 12% decrease in outdoor activities as of April 30, compared to the highest rate during the initial stay-at-home period.

The state with the largest percentage change in stay-at-home rate compared to the peak is Arizona's La Paz County, which reported a 25% increase and now has residents home just 57% of the time. There was a noticeable 4% increase in people venturing out from their homes as of April 30, bringing the overall percentage down to 96%, which is just 4% above the previous stay-at-home record.

Generally, people in rural areas are away from home more than those in urban and suburban areas due to a lack of stores, services, and essential workplaces. People tend to leave their homes far more on weekdays than weekends, so stay-at-home rates were calculated using a seven-day rolling average.","{

After a peak week of sheltering in place in early April, U.S. residents began to inch out of their homes, according to new cellphone data. But even as states begin to âopen up,â more Americans appear to be staying put than sprinting out the door.

See full methodology at bottom of article.

According to a Washington Post analysis of data provided by SafeGraph, a company that aggregates cellphone location information, the peak period of our collective, coronavirus-induced lockdown was the seven-day period ending April 7. (There was also a one-day spike on Easter Sunday.) During that time, U.S. residents spent a whopping 93 percent of their time at home, up from the early March averages of roughly 70 percent.

Some governors began relaxing restrictions meant to curb the spread of covid-19 at the end of April, after they were prodded by President Trump and cautioned by public health officials. But as of April 30, people were still at home an average of 89 percent of the time.

The numbers vary greatly by geography. People in some counties appear to barely leave their homes, especially in large metro areas, including hard-hit New York, Detroit and Chicago. People in areas that are less populated tend to leave a bit more, and residents in at least one very rural county in Arizona are approaching the amount of free-roaming time they enjoyed in early March.

To determine when people are home, SafeGraph obtains GPS data through regular pings from smartphones that are running one or more apps from an undisclosed list. (This type of tracking, which requires users to allow location data when they use certain apps, has rattled privacy experts. App users are often not aware that their data is being used by third-party companies.)

[Itâs the middle of the night. Do you know who your iPhone is talking to?]

The company defines âhomeâ as a common location from which a phone pings between 6 p.m. and 7 a.m. When the phone pings from elsewhere, SafeGraph assumes the phone is away from home.

Itâs not a perfect measure, but the data, aggregated from an average of 18 million phones per day, reveals broad insights.

Hereâs where people are going

Just because people are leaving their homes more doesnât mean theyâre flouting stay-at-home orders or that theyâve abandoned social distancing. They simply may be enjoying warmer weather outdoors, especially in places such as the Upper Midwest, which had an unseasonable April cold snap.

[Americans widely oppose reopening most businesses, Post-U. Md. poll finds]

Pings from phones within businesses and recreational areas show where people are â and arenât â showing up. Theyâre going to parks and grocery stores, according to Google data, which tracks users via their Google Accounts and compares their locations to a baseline from before stay-at-home orders were in place.

Park visits have trended upward recently.

Workplace visits, however, have not. The percentage of phones (and presumably, their owners) in workplaces dropped steeply in mid-March and has barely risen. More than 30 million people have filed for unemployment benefits in the past six weeks.

SafeGraphâs more granular data shows people are again hitting general merchandise stores such as Walmart and Target at near-March levels. Some are satisfying fast-food cravings at restaurants with counter service.

The data lines up with responses in a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll released May 5 in which more than half of people said they were comfortable visiting grocery stores, but 78 percent said they would not be comfortable eating at a sit-down restaurant, and 67 percent said they wouldnât be comfortable shopping in a clothing store. Only 18 percent of respondents were in favor of reopening movie theaters.

State orders donât necessarily dictate behavior

While governors have issued guidelines for reopening their states, businesses and customers have been slow to return in many locales.

One of the earliest states to relax restrictions was Georgia, where a group of southwestern counties are suffering through some of the highest per capita covid-19 death rates in the country. Gov. Brian Kemp (R) allowed spas, hair salons, tattoo parlors, bowling alleys and gyms to reopen on April 24. As of April 30, it did not appear that most Georgians immediately flocked out to get haircuts and hit weight rooms. On average, they were still staying home 86 percent of the time, compared with 92 percent at their early-April peak.

Some states are starting to leave home more than others

Share of time spent at home, for the seven-day period ending on each date

New Jersey South Dakota Select a state: Michigan

In New Jersey, second only to New York in covid-19 deaths, people are spending 96 percent of their time at home, just 1.7 percent less than at the peak. That is both the highest stay-home percentage and the smallest change of any state. Gov. Phil Murphy (D) reopened state parks and golf courses on May 2, but his stay-at-home order is still in effect.

Montanans, by contrast, are going out 10 percent more compared with the peak, the largest change in any state. The state has reported 456 covid-19 cases and 16 deaths as of May 5. Gov. Steve Bullock (D) has allowed retail and churches to reopen and will allow restaurants and schools to open May 7.

Alaskans and South Dakotans are spending the least time at home, 80 percent on average. South Dakota Gov. Kristi L. Noem was one of seven governors to never issue a stay-at-home order. The state has one of the largest coronavirus clusters in the country, at a Smithfield pork-producing plant in Sioux Falls.

Variations on how people move around within states are common and sometimes large, and they often â but not always â follow the pattern of virus outbreaks.

In Florida, people in the populous southern counties of Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach, where most of the stateâs covid-19 cases have been concentrated and where beaches remain closed, are spending about 4 percent more time away from home than in early April. But people in the adjacent counties of Collier and Monroe, which includes the Florida Keys, were out of their houses 13 percent more as of April 30 than at the peak.

[Where people have died of covid-19 by county]

Areas of Georgia around Atlanta showed almost no decrease, led by Forsyth County, which barely budged from its peak of 97 percent at home. By contrast, people in rural Dooly County in the central part of the state were going out 12 percent more than they had at their stay-home peak, despite having a covid-19 death rate that is 19 times higher than Forsythâs.

In Arizonaâs La Paz County, residents are away from home 25 percent more than they were at the peak â the largest change of any county in the country â and theyâre home just 57 percent of the time, roughly the same rate as in early March. In Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, the difference is just 4 percent off the peak, and as of April 30, people were still home 90 percent of the time.

In general, people in rural areas are away more than people in urban and suburban areas, in large part because stores, services and essential workplaces are much farther away and delivery services are rare or nonexistent. But the trend lines are very similar across all types of places.

The data clearly shows that when Americans were told it was time to stay home, most people did. It also indicates that they are deciding for themselves when to go back out.

About this story

Data for this story was provided by SafeGraph, a company that aggregates location data from tens of millions of devices and compares it with building footprints. The Post analyzed its social distancing metrics data set to estimate the share of time spent at home for each county.

The raw numbers fluctuate from day-to-day and county-to-county, and some counties have far fewer devices than others. To account for these challenges, we adjusted the device counts based on population and performed a multilevel regression using a random effects model on the county, state and national levels. Because people tend to leave their homes far more on weekdays than weekends, we chose to calculate a seven-day rolling average, which results in each âdayâ of data including five week and two weekend days.

This analysis relies on defining a âhomeâ location for every device. SafeGraph does this by finding the usual nighttime location of each device over the course of six weeks. It then buckets that location into a grid of roughly 150-meter-wide boxes across the country. When the device remains in that box, it is considered as being home. Of course this is not perfect, but in aggregate and at scale, SafeGraphâs at-home numbers track with other data sources, including location-data research published by other companies and public polling.

Urbanization figures are based on county designations from the National Center for Health Statisticsâs urban-rural classification scheme.

0,"Rome — Italian doctors say they've got the first scientific evidence linking the coronavirus to a rare but deadly inflammatory disease in children. The condition, called pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, has been reported in more than a dozen states across the U.S., including Louisiana, Mississippi, California and New York. Over 100 children have been affected in New York alone, three of whom died, according to Governor Andrew Cuomo.

Doctors had suspected early on that coronavirus played a role in the new disorder by triggering an excessive immune reaction, but there was no clear proof that the two were linked.

Reported in The Lancet medical journal, the new evidence comes from doctors in Bergamo, the epicenter of coronavirus infections and deaths in Italy, where the nationwide reported death toll is more than 30,000, behind only Britain and the United States.

Doctors at the Papa Giovanni XXIII hospital compared a series of 10 cases of the illness with cases of a similar rare condition in children called Kawasaki disease, finding a 30-fold increase in cases of Kawasaki-like disease in patients between February and April.

The acceleration of cases occurred at a pace of about one every three months, indicating a cluster that was fueled by the coronavirus outbreak, especially, the authors noted, since overall hospital admissions were much lower than usual during national stay-at-home orders.

""Our study provides the first clear evidence of a link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and this inflammatory condition, and we hope it will help doctors around the world as we try to get to grips with this unknown virus,"" said Dr. Lorenzo D'Antiga, director of child health at the hospital, in The Guardian.

None of the 10 children in Bergamo died, but the authors reported that their symptoms were much more severe than those of the children with Kawasaki disease. Heart complications were more common, as were lower counts of platelets. A type of white blood cell typical of coronavirus patients was also more prevalent.

Five of the children experienced shock, which did not occur in any of the Kawasaki patients.

The researchers also highlighted that eight of the 10 children tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies, indicating that the children had been infected with the virus weeks earlier. They suspect that the two other children may have been false negatives, due to imperfect tests.

While Kawasaki disease tends to strike infants and preschoolers, the 10 children with the mysterious disorder were generally several years older. The average age of the Kawasaki patients was 7 years old; the average age of the children with this condition was 3.5 years old.

The doctors warn that the ""strong association"" between the coronavirus and the inflammatory condition should be taken into account as governments around the world ease lockdown restrictions.

But they also stressed that a significant majority of children exposed to the virus (more than 99%) do not develop this inflammatory condition, and only a small fraction require intensive care. Even fewer die.

}","The Food and Drug Administration is ""digging into"" data that says a popular coronavirus test may give inaccurate results, Commissioner Stephen Hahn said. However, Hahn said the agency recommends that the Abbott Laboratory test, which is used to test President Donald Trump and White House staffers, still be available for use.

The FDA issued an emergency authorization in March for the Abbott ID NOW point-of-care test, which delivers results in minutes. The FDA published a warning about it on Thursday after an NYU Langone Health study, which has not been peer-reviewed, found that it might return false negatives — meaning it might say a person doesn't have the virus when they actually do.

""What we're saying is that there are some data to suggest that there may be inaccuracies, false negatives, with the Abbott test. However, there are many users who have contacted us and have not had this problem, so FDA is digging into it, and we're working with Abbott to actually look at what data are available to get the most up to date and accurate information about the test performance,"" Hahn said on ""CBS This Morning"" Friday. ""That being said, the test is on the market. We continue to recommend its use or to have it available for use.""

Hahn also noted that point-of-care tests in general ""would have a lower sensitivity than a test that's based in the laboratory.""

""We've known that for years,"" he said, but added that the data the FDA used to grant the emergency use authorization for the Abbott test ""were very robust.""

The purpose of the new FDA warning was to make sure providers have the information about what the test does.

""So for example, if a person you suspect — a doctor suspects a person has the disease, it might be worth, if the test is negative, getting a second confirmatory test. That's what our guidance is about,"" he said.

Hahn said the FDA is providing guidance to the White House about the test, but said it is up to them if they choose to keep using it. Mr. Trump has praised the test as ""ultra-fast"" and ""very accurate.""

Abbott said while some studies have shown the ""sensitivity performance percentages,"" or true positive rates, of the test to be in the 80s, others have shown it at or above 90%, and one showed it as high as 94%.

""We're seeing studies being conducted to understand the role of ID NOW in ways that it was not designed to be used. In particular, the NYU study results are not consistent with other studies,"" the statement said. ""While we understand no test is perfect, test outcomes depend on a number of factors including patient selection, specimen type, collection, handling, storage, transport and conformity to the way the test was designed to be run. ID NOW is intended to be used near the patient with a direct swab test method.""

The company also said it will clarify its guidelines and continue ""to optimize"" the test.

Hahn also was asked about the testing capacity in the United States.

""We continue to work with close to 300 test developers. We have not taken our foot off the pedal with respect to this,"" he said. ""We recognize the need to get more tests on the market, and we're working with developers to do that.""

He said there are a number of factors contributing to delays in more tests, including the need for data before authorizing a test and an ""unprecedented demand for the tests.""

Hahn would not say if putting the onus on states to run testing and contact tracing was the best approach, but said, ""there are unique circumstances in the states.""

""The governors understand what best happens in the states, and we will provide them as much support as we possibly can to make the absolute best public health decisions,"" he said.","{

They have much clearer shot migrating out of these urban deserts to local regional capitals with easy access to the global travel network. But none of the public health staff are empowered to talk about or act upon the ""c-word"" driving these outbreaks. It is the unspeakable prime directive at the heart of global political economy. And so scientists are stuck with the impossible task of merely cleaning up after the epidemiological messes of the very system producing these outbreaks.

Sputnik: What, in your opinion, needs to be done in order to ensure the likelihood of future outbreaks is reduced as well as sufficiently mitigating against them when they do occur?

Dr Rob Wallace: Responding with proper programs in public health, including the right supply of hospital capacity and PPE [Personal Protection Equipment] and antivirals and employment insurance, are all necessary. Seems trite, but many of the richest industrial countries have flat-out failed in such basics. A lack of resources wasn't the problem. The political class's refusal to pay for them under the most Malthusian of justifications is the revulsion to blame.

Bigger picture, but not unrelated, we must also change our very way of social reproduction or how we reproduce our societies generation to generation. We must reintegrate humanity into the ecologies we share with other creatures in such a way that we accept, and respond to, the consequences of appropriating the resources we need to survive as a species. We must end expropriating land and labour to the point that capital can get away with externalising the worst costs of production -- climate change, pollution, labour morbidity, land grabs, declines in nutrition, and pandemics, among many other damage--onto everyone else.

But what's key is recognizing the primary drivers of disease transmission. It's not just the environmental or geographical factors that contribute to these outbreaks; it's also our cultural exchange programs, global travel, and social media interactions that facilitate the rapid spread of infectious diseases.

It's a sociopathic way of living that requires radical recalibration. Otherwise, given the scale of our present civilization, we threaten to end society as we know it the world over. That might involve both the bang of a pandemic that kills a billion people and the whimper of drawn-out pulses in shifts in climate. We deserve better. We can use our brilliant collective minds and our everyday-apparent compassion to readjust our shared community to another mode of living entirely. Even in the face of what seem such terrible odds. We have no choice otherwise.

Dr Wallace received his Ph.D. in biology at the CUNY Graduate Center, and did post-doctorate work at the University of California, Irvine, with Walter Fitch, a founder of molecular phylogeny. He is a Visiting Scholar at the Institute for Global Studies, University of Minnesota and has consulted with the Food and Agriculture Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Sputnik: What exactly is an evolutionary epidemiologist, and what is it that you specialise in?

Dr Rob Wallace: We all know that infectious diseases spread, but as they spread they also evolve. An evolutionary epidemiologist uses methods and concepts in population biology to describe how pathogens evolve in the course of diffusing across a landscape.

I specialise on applying principles in economic geography to explain how major threats such as avian and swine influenza, Ebola, Zika, and SARS-CoV-2 spread and evolve in response to the world as it presently is -- largely structured around circuits of capital and production.

Sputnik: Explain the main thesis of your book Big Farms Make Big Flu. How much of your work has predicted the emergence of something like the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)?

Dr Rob Wallace: It was only upon touring for my book back in 2017 that I thought through the best encapsulation of its thesis: As we industrialise the production of food, we also industrialise the pathogens that circulate among our livestock and crops. This mode of food production, producing, in livestock, cities of monoculture hog and chickens and other livestock and poultry around the world, is selecting for pathogens that are deadlier, more infectious, and of a wider diversity.

Now, that description accounts for pathogens that have made their way to the intensive farms within the spatial orbits of many a city. At the other end of regional production circuits, pathogens oft-spill directly from increasingly encroached-upon forests and the wild animals there, the reservoirs of exotic pathogens to which few humans have been exposed.

When we log, mine, or replace primary forest with plantation agriculture, we simplify the forest in such a way that deadly pathogens previously bottled up in wildlife are able to spring free.

Sputnik: You've co-authored an article arguing that the ""failure to prepare for and react"" to the COVID-19 outbreak have been decades in the making. Can you explain what you mean by this?

Dr Rob Wallace: Pandemics are mirrors. They tell a society its status. Over the past forty years, public health in the U.S., for instance, has been both neglected and monetised to the point that what was a social commons is largely individualised at the point of contact with insurance companies that may, or may not, pay for a treatment.

A pandemic pathogen doesn't subscribe to that model of intervention. Indeed, as we already see, COVID-19 is affecting the poorest and most oppressed to the point that it overloads health systems so that the health needs of everyone else other than the very richest are affected as well. For systems so interested in privatising every part of society, the most basic truisms of human community, such as the health of everyone is interconnected, are appearing such a shock.

The U.S.'s ruling class cannot recognise itself in the pandemic save in passing off the worst damage upon the 99%.

Sputnik: To what extent has the preparation for a global pandemic and handling of the current crisis been lacking?

Dr Rob Wallace: Upon bird flu H5N1 in 1997 and again in 2003, the various U.N. health agencies --WHO, [Food and Agriculture Organization], [International Organisation of Employers] -- put their territorialism aside and began to work together through how the health of wildlife, livestock, and humans are interconnected. So both the scientific community and many a health officer placed the possibility of a pandemic front and centre.

But governments worldwide treated every subsequent outbreak as some new and unconnected shock: SARS-1, H1N1 (2009), MERS, Ebola in West Africa and the Congo, Zika, and so on. Each outbreak was treated as an emergency at the expense of discussing and responding to the structural causes shared across the series of outbreaks.

There are many such causes, but the big one is treated as much a part of our world as gravity or the sun. Centres of capital the world over are funding deforestation and development on forest frontiers across the world, expanding the interface between animal disease reservoirs and newly placed livestock and the labour tending them.

An increasing diversity of pathogens are now spilling over and they have much clearer shot migrating out of the deepest forests to local regional capitals with easy access to the global travel network. But none of the public health staff are empowered to talk about or act upon the ""c-word"" driving these outbreaks. It is the unspeakable prime directive at the heart of global political economy. And so scientists are stuck with the impossible task of merely cleaning up after the epidemiological messes of the very system producing these outbreaks.

Sputnik: What, in your opinion, needs to be done in order to ensure the likelihood of future outbreaks is reduced as well as sufficiently mitigating against them when they do occur?

Dr Rob Wallace: Responding with proper programs in public health, including the right supply of hospital capacity and PPE [Personal Protection Equipment] and antivirals and employment insurance, are all necessary. Seems trite, but many of the richest industrial countries have flat-out failed in such basics. A lack of resources wasn't the problem. The political class's refusal to pay for them under the most Malthusian of justifications is the revulsion to blame.

Bigger picture, but not unrelated, we must also change our very way of social reproduction or how we reproduce our societies generation to generation. We must reintegrate humanity into the ecologies we share with other creatures in such a way that we accept, and respond to, the consequences of appropriating the resources we need to survive as a species. We must end expropriating land and labour to the point that capital can get away with externalising the worst costs of production -- climate change, pollution, labour morbidity, land grabs, declines in nutrition, and pandemics, among many other damage--onto everyone else. That selects for the utterly worst behaviours possible.

It's a sociopathic way of living that requires radical recalibration. Otherwise, given the scale of our present civilisation, we threaten to end society as we know it the world over. That might involve both the bang of a pandemic that kills a billion people and the whimper of drawn-out pulses in shifts in climate. We deserve better. We can use our brilliant collective minds and our everyday-apparent compassion to readjust our shared community to another mode of living entirely. Even in the face of what seem such terrible odds. We have no choice otherwise.

“Magnesium Elektron North America (MENA) has three sites that also supply magnesium sheet and coil for commercial, aerospace and defense applications,” states the company in a corporate brochure (see page 13 bit.ly/2WEQ03L )

A company spokesperson confirmed to Reuters via email that the “the factory in Madison, IL does not produce Magnesium Stearate.”

Conclusion

The two fire incidents did happen a day apart, but the plants in these fires do not produce magnesium stearate for hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.

The claim comes amidst the worldwide search for a COVID-19 treatment and vaccine. Demand for hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug, surged after Trump touted it as a potential treatment for the novel coronavirus in early April. U.S. regulators have since authorized its emergency use for COVID-19 patients ( here ).

While the drug has not been proven effective against the disease ( here , here ), it is being widely studied in the U.S. and abroad as a potential COVID-19 treatment ( here ).

VERDICT

False. These two unrelated fires did not affect plants that produce magnesium stearate.

The shelter-in-place order had been lifted, and the county was now promoting business activities. Officials were having private meetings with Elon Musk to discuss the details of the business-as-usual permit and golden ticket requirements.

Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, tweeted that the company would sue Alameda County over the business-as-usual permit. The lawsuit claimed that the county's requirements for reopening were too restrictive and exclusive.

Musk mentioned that if Tesla relocated its headquarters and future programs to New York/Canada at all, it would depend on how Tesla was treated in the future. Tesla has no comment on the matter.","{

}","After Alameda County health officials cautioned Tesla against reopening its California car factory yesterday, CEO Elon Musk tweeted today that the company would sue the county and move its headquarters out of state. Hours later, Tesla’s attorneys filed suit in US District Court in the Northern District of California seeking an injunction against the county’s shelter-in-place order, because it “contradicts the Governor’s Order to the extent it restricts the operation of business operating in the federal critical infrastructure sectors.”

“Tesla is filing a lawsuit against Alameda County immediately,” Musk said on Twitter. “The unelected & ignorant ‘interim Health Officer’ of Alameda is acting contrary to the Governor, the President, our Constitutional freedoms & just plain common sense!”

Musk has been a vocal critic of coronavirus shelter-in-place orders, saying at the company’s April 29th earnings call that such restrictions were “fascist” and not democratic. “We are a bit worried about not being able to resume production in the Bay Area, and that should be identified as a serious risk,” Musk said. He also urged supporters on Twitter to “please voice your disagreement as strongly as possible with Alameda County.”

An Alameda County spokesperson said in a statement to The Verge on Saturday that the county Health Care Services Agency and Public Health Department have been “communicating directly and working closely with the Tesla team on the ground in Fremont. This has been a collaborative, good faith effort to develop and implement a safety plan that allows for reopening while protecting the health and well-being of the thousands of employees who travel to and from work at Tesla’s factory.”

The spokesperson added that the team at Tesla had been responsive to guidance and recommendations “and we look forward to coming to an agreement on an appropriate safety plan very soon.” The statement, issued several hours after Musk’s tweets, did not reference the Tesla CEO’s comments or mention him by name.

Frankly, this is the final straw. Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately. If we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependen on how Tesla is treated in the future. Tesla is the last carmaker left in CA. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 9, 2020

“We appreciate that our residents and businesses have made tremendous sacrifices and that together we have been able to save lives and protect community health in our region,“ the statement continues. “It is our collective responsibility to move through the phases of reopening and loosening the restrictions of the Shelter-in-Place Order in the safest way possible, guided by data and science.”

Tesla announced plans to resume “limited operations” at its Fremont facility yesterday, which would bring back about 30 percent of its workforce. But officials in Alameda County, where Fremont is located, said yesterday that it was still under a shelter-in-place order and that Tesla it didn’t meet its criteria to reopen. “We have not said that it’s appropriate to move forward,” said Erica Pan, Alameda County’s health officer, according to Bloomberg.

California Governor Gavin Newsom said Thursday that state-level guidance allowing manufacturing to resume some production didn’t supersede county-level restrictions. The company had unsucessfully tried to argue that Tesla’s production should be considered critical infrastructure.

The Fremont plant, where Tesla assembles its Model 3, Model S, Model X, and Model Y vehicles, was temporarily closed March 23rd to comply with the shelter-in-place order. Tesla reduced pay for all its US salaried employees as of April 13th and put most hourly workers who can’t work remotely on unpaid furlough. What would happen to the roughly 10,000 workers at the Fremont plant if Tesla were to move operations out of state as Musk tweeted, was unclear.

Both Tesla and Musk settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2018 over Musk’s tweets about taking Tesla private. Then, in 2019, the terms of the settlement were renegotiated. Under the new terms, a company lawyer must approve Musk’s tweets about certain parts of Tesla’s business before Musk sends them. That includes any announcement that would trigger a filing of the form 8-K, which is used for announcing unscheduled material events, to the SEC. As of this writing, Tesla has not filed an 8-K about Musk’s proposed factory move.

Tesla did not reply to a request for comment.

0,"How important a role will contact tracing play in reopening the economy?

Contact tracing will have little impact. We have this blunt tool, which is sheltering in place, and that really drives down the spread of the virus. Then we have more precise but not as strong tools. One toolset is the way we design [workplaces] for the age of COVID, which includes no-touch doors, no-touch elevators and no-touch hand sanitizer. We have partitions and other design solutions to make a safer world.

Another set of inventions are precise tools that are the ""Box It In"" tools. They are to test, isolate, contact trace and quarantine — those are the four corners of our box. If any corner of that box is weak, the virus can get out and spread, but if you are in a workplace and there is a case [of COVID-19] you have to follow the exposure protocols.

How many contact tracers will we need?

If we were to hire a team of highly trained ninjas to perform contact tracing in the US, it would likely require a force of approximately 300,000 stealthy operatives. The exact number depends on the number of cases and the efficiency of the process — how readily people cooperate with the process.

I also think it's important to emphasize that contact tracing is not a simple job. There is a misconception that anyone can do it. It's a hard job that requires people skills, medical knowledge, resourcefulness, the ability to reach people and establish, build and maintain trust. You should also be tech-savvy to reach people and identify their contacts. It will be a major facilitator of economic recovery from the pandemic perspective.

Do you agree with the plan President Trump has set out for gradually reopening the economy, or are we being too hasty?

I think the guidelines outlined by the White House were sensible. They outlined things that are important to track in order to know we are not likely to have an explosion of cases when we reopen.

On the other hand, people are very impatient to go out, and there hasn't been a consistent and clear explanation to the public of what the reasons are for having to stay apart or having to continue to refrain from certain activities. I think that reflects messaging that hasn't been consistent and science-based. If people are impatient to go out, you hope at least when they go out, they will do so as safely as possible.","{

}","CBS MoneyWatch spoke with Dr. Tom Frieden, who was director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2009-2017, about the challenge of reopening the American economy even as COVID-19 deaths continue to climb and before any effective treatments are available to combat the disease. This interview has been edited for clarity and length.

As we look for sensible ways to jump-start the battered U.S. economy, which industries should reopen first, and which would you reopen last?

Dr. Tom Frieden: Things that can open first include lower-risk physical businesses like restaurants doing takeout and outdoor recreation. Day care, as well, is enormously important economically, and may be able to reopen relatively soon in this process as long as you keep vulnerable staff and children out and make it clear that children and staff participating could potentially be exposed.

The places that are hardest are places where lots of people are indoors and there is limited space, or where there is lots of travel. Bars, the tourism industry, conventions, conferences, some cultural events, some indoor sporting events are going to be really tough. There may be a way for sporting events with few or no in-person spectators and cultural events with masks on the audience, hand sanitizer and potentially other safety and sanitary features to get back to a newer reality, but it isn't going to be easy.

We have to be careful about things that can backfire if we end up coming out too soon and that result in the substantial spread of the virus. That will be counterproductive to the reopening of the economy.

How will workplaces need to adapt? What will the office of the future look like, for instance?

I do think that, until we have either a vaccine or a highly effective treatment, the workplace will be different. We are going to have to reimagine the workplace and its design for the new reality. That will mean less travel, more telework and fewer meetings. When we do go back to our offices, there will be mandatory hand sanitizer as we enter, no common snack rooms. We'll be physically distancing, even at work, for the foreseeable future.

We will be physically distancing in meetings, and we will avoid communal gatherings. We'll be ensuring people don't come to work sick. De-densifying will be a big part of it — also splitting schedules, days, hours and travel, which defeats the purpose of having people together in one space. But it's a way of starting that limits the risk.

Do you expect many of these changes to be permanent, or only temporary until the virus is under control?

I predict we will see permanent work-from-home options. A lot of people will realize they don't need to rent expensive office space when people can work from home with a similar level of efficiency. I do think more telework and less travel are here to stay for a while. I also think we are inevitably going to see more travel restrictions, and potentially 14-day quarantines when you go to a new country. It's very old-fashioned — it goes back half a millennium or more. But if your country or state or province has gone through a tremendous effort to control the virus, you won't want to allow the unlimited travel of people who may unwittingly spread the virus in your country.

We are also going to have to better accommodate people who are vulnerable to the disease — the elderly and people with underlying health conditions. People who are particularly vulnerable will stay out longer if they can telework. If they can't, they'll need some form of disability so we can get back to work sooner without risking the health of the most vulnerable, and so they don't pay the economic price for that.

You are currently president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, a global non-profit that works to prevent death from cardiovascular disease and to stop epidemics. What kinds of changes will you make within your own workplace?

[We redid] our workplace a year ago at Resolve To Save Lives, which is housed within Vital Strategies, and it's largely open plan. There are partitions between desks, but there are lots of small meeting rooms. That's a problem as we put plans in place to reopen. We'll have to convert meeting rooms to individual offices or seal them off, because you can't have small meeting rooms where you are sitting one foot away from each other and have multiple people using the same room throughout the course of day — that's not safe. We have two conference rooms that are large enough for a small meeting with people sitting far apart from one another. We'll have to change the other conference rooms to offices.

Ex-CDC director outlines four key measures to ""go back to new normal""

What are the risks — to public health in the U.S. and to the economy — of reopening too quickly?

We are all anxious to get back out into the new normal, and there are some activities we can do with little-to-no risk. Outdoor activities, for example, are far less risky than indoor activities. But the risk is that if we reopen too soon, we will rekindle infections. It won't be a question of a second wave, but many waves. No one knows how the virus will behave in warm weather. There may be less risk or there may not be. But still, the vast majority of Americans are vulnerable to this virus.

We do have to balance our economy and public health measures, and what we found from around the country and around the world is that the places that implemented public health measures the best also protect their economy the best.

There is a misconception that the major economic harm is from the government orders to stay at home. That's actually not necessarily the case. People are understandably afraid that if they go out to the store, they could get an infection that kills them or a vulnerable parent. Even where physical distancing recommendations are reduced, there is a delay in people going back out. The bigger issue is that we have to come to terms with the fact that this is a bad pandemic and it's just the beginning of a long fight against it.

Many small businesses have been seriously hurt by the shutdown and are understandably eager to reopen their doors. What's your message to them?

If your customers die from an infection they get in your shop, it's not good for your business. So it's in everyone's interest to make a business as safe as possible.

This is not about public health versus the economy. In order to make the economy healthier, we need to control the virus. It's also in the interest of business people to have a strong public health system, so people who may be brewing infection are warned and quarantined and don't come into your shop, and people who are infected are identified and isolated so they don't spread it. The more we box the virus in, the more space there is for us in society.

How important a role will contact tracing play in reopening the economy?

Contact tracing will be very important. We have this blunt tool, which is sheltering in place, and that really drives down the spread of the virus. Then we have more precise but not as strong tools. One toolset is the way we design [workplaces] for the age of COVID, which includes no-touch doors, no-touch elevators and no-touch hand sanitizer. We have partitions and other design solutions to make a safer world.

Another set of inventions are precise tools that are the ""Box It In"" tools. They are to test, isolate, contact trace and quarantine — those are the four corners of our box. If any corner of that box is weak, the virus can get out and spread, but if you are in a workplace and there is a case [of COVID-19] you have to follow the exposure protocols.

How many contact tracers will we need?

If the ratio of contact tracers needed in the U.S. is the same as the number they used in Wuhan, China, it would be about 300,000 people. The exact number depends on the number of cases and the efficiency of the process — how readily people cooperate with the process.

I also think it's important to emphasize that contact tracing is not a simple job. There is a misconception that anyone can do it. It's a hard job that requires people skills, medical knowledge, resourcefulness, the ability to reach people and establish, build and maintain trust. You should also be tech-savvy to reach people and identify their contacts. It will be a major facilitator of economic recovery from the pandemic perspective.

Do you agree with the plan President Trump has set out for gradually reopening the economy, or are we being too hasty?

I think the guidelines outlined by the White House were sensible. They outlined things that are important to track in order to know we are not likely to have an explosion of cases when we reopen.

On the other hand, people are very impatient to go out, and there hasn't been a consistent and clear explanation to the public of what the reasons are for having to stay apart or having to continue to refrain from certain activities. I think that reflects messaging that hasn't been consistent and science-based. If people are impatient to go out, you hope at least when they go out, they will do so as safely as possible.","{

}","Chongqing Medical University China has found that nearly everyone who recovers from COVID-19 will develop antibodies to it; 95% of the patients were found to have had the immune cells within three weeks.

According to the recent research nearly everyone who becomes infected with this virus and goes on to recover will develop antibodies to it; 95% of the 285 patients developed both types of immune cells that fight this virus.

Globally antibody testing is being geared up in an attempt to see who has already had the virus and was able to develop some potential form of natural protection against reinfection from COVID-19. However, many questions remain around these antibodies such as whether everyone will develop them, what level is necessary to confer protection, and just how long the protection if any will last.

This study was designed to help answer one of those question and it “brings much-needed clarity, along with renewed enthusiasm, to efforts to develop and implement widescale antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2,” wrote Dr Francis Collins on the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) Director's blog.

By this point just about everyone has heard about antibodies and knows that they are immune cells that the body develops in a unique response to a given pathogen, and if you have never had exposure to a virus or bacterium you will not develop antibodies to it. In response to most infections the body will start producing these specialized cells that will recognize and target an infection should it occur again, often it will neutralize the pathogen entirely.

Coronaviruses are much like those that cause the common cold, from what is known about other coronaviruses scientists are guessing that humans will develop antibodies against this novel version. Up until recently there was no knowing for sure until they were able to study patients.

In this study the blood of 258 patients was monitored for signs of immune cells; humans produce two types of antibodies Igm and IgG. The first is produced early after infection and these IgM antibodies provide a short burst of protection before fading away; 40% of the patients had produced IgM antibodies within the first week of infection, and after two weeks of observation 95% had developed detectable levels of IgM and were producing IgG antibodies that take longer to develop but have more potential for long term protection.

In a follow up study blood was collected from another 69 patients, and within 20 days all but two patients produced antibodies; those two patients were a related mother and daughter.

To determine how much protection these antibodies carry and for how long they confer immunity scientists will need to continue to study patients and follow them, perhaps even doing challenge experiments to expose them to the virus again to see if their antibodies will protect them from reinfections.

However, until enough time has passed for such studies to be completed these studies are indeed an encouraging sign that the human body is able to learn and develop defenses against COVID-19 after exposure. If this turns out to be the case humanity may be able to develop some form of herd immunity against COVID-19 that would help to keep possible future cases of this virus from reaching epidemic levels as are currently being experienced on a global scale.

“There’s still a way to go with both virus and antibody testing for COVID-19,” wrote Dr Collins. “But as this study and others begin to piece together the complex puzzle of antibody-mediated immunity, it will be possible to learn more about the human body’s response to SARS-CoV-2 and home in on our goal of achieving safe, effective, and sustained protection against this devastating disease.”","{

}","Grounded planes at Brisbane Airport on April 21 in Brisbane, Australia Jono Searle/Getty Images

America is grounded on account of the COVID-19 pandemic. Photos of thousands of airliners crammed onto unused runways and any available tarmac space take place in our national lockdown’s gallery of eerie images. Domestic passenger traffic numbers are down about 95 percent from a year earlier. Airlines have canceled most flights as they lose tens of millions of dollars a day, and there is little indication that demand for air travel will pick up anytime soon. The federal government did step in to provide the industry with $25 billion in emergency grants and loans to preserve the nation’s circulatory system and prevent a total collapse—aid conditioned upon the airlines continuing to serve all their domestic markets and avoiding any layoffs until September.

Against this backdrop, Future Tense editorial director Andrés Martinez invited three aviation experts to talk on Slack about when, and how, Americans might take flight again. Seth Kaplan is the transportation analyst for NPR’s Here & Now, the author of Glory Lost and Found: How Delta Climbed From Despair to Dominance in the Post-9/11 Era , and co-host of the Airlines Confidential podcast.* Benét Wilson is the credit card editor for the Points Guy. She’s a veteran aviation journalist who has written for such publications as USA Today and Aviation Daily and is known among her peers as the aviation queen. Christopher Schaberg is the Dorothy Harrell Brown distinguished professor of English at Loyola University–New Orleans and the author of The End of Airports.

On May 21 at 4 p.m. Eastern, Future Tense will host an online event asking, “Will We Ever Fly Again?” RSVP now.

Andrés Martinez: Seth, let me start with you on an, um, easy question: When do you think we will get back to 2019 levels (or those of January, for that matter, when we saw a 5 percent increase in passenger traffic of air travel)?

Seth Kaplan: We’ve never seen anything like this. In fact, not only is this worse than each of the prior crises (9/11, SARS, the Great Recession, etc.)—it’s worse than all of them combined. The answer to when we will return to something resembling normal really depends on the course of the pandemic itself, when there will be a vaccine, etc. If you could tell me the answer to that, I could tell you what will happen with aviation. But it’s difficult to imagine a nearly normal year before 2022, if not 2023.

Benét Wilson: Another big thing is airlines winning the trust of travelers by ensuring that planes are clean enough and there are enough proper social distancing protocols in place, from the time people enter the airport to the time they’re on board in their seats. That’s going to be a challenge.

Christopher Schaberg: Yes, Benét has hit on a key issue: There’s public health, and then there’s personal risk. Both of these collide intensely at airports and on airplanes.

Andrés: In recent years, we all entered into a pact with airlines: Cram however many of us as you need to onto the back of those planes to keep fares low. That’s been the basis of the democratization of flight (though we still complain about being crammed in). Benét, is the current crisis going to result in the end of that bargain? Do you think we are going to see flying again become an elite pursuit, with lowest fares to fly across the country starting at a couple grand to accommodate social distancing concerns? Or will all this pass?

Benét: I’m old enough to have flown regularly on airlines in the pre-deregulation age. My father was an Air Force officer, and we traveled the world back then, when air travel was mostly for the rich. I can envision a scenario where fares will go up, making air travel less accessible. Airlines need to keep butts in seats and their balance books in the black. Frontier had to walk back charging travelers for an empty middle seat. But when you squeeze, that toothpaste is coming out, one way or another.

Andrés: Chris, you recently wrote a moving ode to empty airports. We always assumed there was an inevitability about the continued expansion of travel and shrinking of the world. But did your ruminations about empty airports make you—should they make us—question those assumptions?

Christopher: The unknowns right now are so wildly beyond anyone’s calculations or control. It’s hard to say. But we are now realizing just how much faith we had—for so long!—in the “ongoingness” of air travel basically as a static enterprise. Now we’re suddenly faced with a wide range of possibilities, from back to the status quo on the one side to a near-total wind-down of commercial flight on the other. And it really seems like anything in between could occur.

I think we may have reached—or even crossed—a threshold of growth that is (and has been, frankly) unsustainable. For several decades it seemed like unlimited growth was entirely possible and inevitable (speaking of commercial flight specifically, here), and now we’re having to reassess the assumptions that made such growth believable and possible. It’s hard for me to see how we’ll simply return to the level of flights from a few months ago—and keep growing—because COVID-19 has given a jolt to the system—a jolt that is also connected (if not directly) to broader environmental issues surrounding flight, which are not going away but are only foregrounded now with cleaner and quieter skies, etc.

Andrés: True, flight shaming due to climate was starting to be a bit of a thing pre-pandemic, especially in Europe. Seth, do you think airlines have been worried about this environmental concern as a long-term threat to their business?

Seth: It had certainly moved from the back of their minds to the forefront. An existential threat? I don’t think most of them considered it that. But a long-term threat to one degree or another? Absolutely. Until Greta Thunberg’s journey, I don’t think very many people viewed global travel by air as anything other than aspirational—a force for good. If it’s becoming socially unacceptable among any meaningful number of people—something to be ashamed of—that’s unhelpful for airlines. It’s a question of degree, and I think the best bet now is a measurable but not overwhelming avoidance of flying by some people.

Christopher: It seems like we’ve kind of moved from flight shame to flight fear, but these two things might become increasingly conflated—and equally existentially dangerous for airlines.

Benét: Last week I drove from Baltimore to my family home in San Antonio. I dropped off the car at San Antonio International Airport and looked at everything with the coronavirus lens. Will I use those water bottle fill stations? How will we social distance at TSA checkpoints? How will bins and checkpoint areas be cleaned? How will eateries and retail handle passengers? So many questions that need to be answered.

Andrés: You brought up the Frontier Airlines episode from this week. They wanted to charge passengers $39 to block middle seats; there was an outcry; they backtracked. That reminded me of an interesting story Richard Aboulafia wrote for Future Tense on how the industry has always had an unwritten rule that thou shalt not compete on safety grounds. But in a pandemic environment, it’s going to be hard to distinguish between marketing for comfort and for safety. Is that business class pod just a way to get a nice sleep on your way to London or a means of preserving your life?

Benét: I’m looking at that JetBlue Mint seat with the door I flew on in a whole new light. Same with other airlines that have pods. I feel sorry for the airlines having to walk that fine line between comfort and safety. I fear there will be a few more stumbles of this sort before we settle into a new normal.

Seth: What’s interesting is that a few airlines around the world have, for several years, allowed customers to bid to be seated next to any empty seats, and of course there was no outcry when it was only a question of comfort, not hoping to avoid a deadly virus. Now, granted, the middle seat on Frontier is only 18 inches wide, not 6 feet, so it’s reasonable to say it’s selling only a false sense of security, not true security, anyway. But to Aboulafia’s point, if it had already been offering to block middle seats for $39 prior to all this, that would be different. To the larger point: Decades ago, if you asked fliers what they cared about when they chose an airline, they would mention safety alongside price and schedule. In recent years, they wouldn’t, not because they didn’t care about safety but because they took for granted that all airlines were basically quite safe. Now we see airlines sort of competing, however cordially, for which one provides the most social distance in an environment not designed for social distancing. At some point, maybe after there’s a vaccine, that will start to fade again as a marketing tool, so to speak, but just the fact that we’re there, however temporarily it might be, is remarkable.

Andrés: Beyond the issue of fares needing to match supply and demand, which we alluded to above, do you guys think this crisis will accelerate other trends we were already seeing in aviation?

Seth: I think consolidation is somewhat back in play, because regulators are more likely to approve a merger or acquisition if companies can argue that absent it, one company (if not both) would go out of business anyway. U.S. airlines couldn’t, with a straight face, in recent years, claim to face any existential threats. Now they can. I’m not saying it’s going to happen, but it’s more likely because of that.

Christopher: It seems like one thing we could see (this is a bit dystopian, perhaps), is a stark two-cabin model where $$$ first-class seats have even more space between them, and then in back (after a severe dividing wall) there are the standing chairs (remember those?) for steerage. This probably won’t happen, but I’ll bet at least one airline is looking into it.

Benét: I remember how airlines pulled back on free meals after 9/11, going toward a buy- on-board model. We’re already seeing airlines taking away that option, along with alcohol too.

Seth: Yes, I think we can forget about some of the modest amenities U.S. airlines have restored in economy in recent years. The stroopwafels might have gone away on health grounds (to minimize nonessential interactions between flight attendants and customers), but I don’t think they’ll come back the moment it’s safe. These airlines are back to trying to get through the day, focusing on needs and not wants.

Andrés: I do miss those stroopwafels, United’s great innovation of the past decade.

Christopher: I too remember after 9/11 when all that free food went away. I was working at an airport at the time and used to live on all the extra boxed meals we’d unload at the end of the day. Then, suddenly, they were just gone.

Andrés: To Seth’s earlier point, we take for granted now how safe flying really has been. … We can reasonably assume planes don’t fall out of the air. But occasionally other concerns pop up, such as terrorism post- 9/11, which led to the creation of TSA, the end of being able to meet loved ones at gates, the ritual of taking off shoes and dispensing with liquids at security. Now our safety concerns are shifting and I see TSA relaxing liquids rules and allowing expired driver’s licenses to go through! (Imagine that on 9/12!)

Christopher: I know, all those new 12-ounce bottles of hand sanitizer let through! Really?!?

Seth: Every crisis changes the industry, so it’s reasonable to think the biggest crisis will change the industry in big ways. But typically, there’s an (understandably) big reaction to a crisis, and then things get ratcheted back. Flying became a lot more of a hassle after 9/11, but eventually we got PreCheck and so forth.

Christopher: Or it’s possible that all the empty planes flying overhead right now will be seen as the most ridiculous last grasp at keeping this enterprise called commercial flight alive.

Andrés: So I want to pin you guys down a bit more. It’s 2030 … what is it like to fly? Don’t answer, “It depends on the pandemic.”

Benét: I must resist the temptation to predict we’ll all be in those flying cars we’ve been waiting for since the 1950s …

Seth: I’ll start with an easy one: We are all becoming permanently more germophobic, and we will forever see some number of people, even if just a few, wearing masks on flights—including just domestic flights in the U.S.—even after there’s a vaccine and there’s no specific, immediate threat.

Christopher: I have a hope: that in 2030 commercial flight takes place at a fraction of what 2019’s levels were and people understand that flying is for special, “essential” travel. And airlines have adjusted and contracted to meet this demand. But the more cynical side of me thinks that in 2030 it will look a lot like 2019 but even worse, and yet climate change and other environmental disasters will be making life harder for those living in the poorest nations and hardest parts of the world.

Andrés: You don’t believe it’s beneficial travel has become more accessible and commonplace in recent years?

Christopher: The accessibility of flight was beneficial, to a point—but then it metastasized so quickly.

Andrés: The real explosion in traffic has been overseas, with the rise of the global middle class. Isn’t it hard to tell people elsewhere they can’t enjoy our way of life because they are late to the party?

Christopher: It is a real tension, for sure. But the “party” metaphor is apt: The party can only go on for so long before everyone is throwing up.

Seth: This is why many people feel a true global price on carbon, which includes aviation, is the way forward. The idea is, you let people make their own choices, but pricing in the impact of those choices.

Benét: I see a global contraction, with a governmental organization overseeing the airline industry as the Civil [Aeronautics] Board once did.

It will regulate fleets and schedules, eliminating competition. Fares will be higher, and not everyone will be able to afford to fly. But it will insulate the industry from future chaos, where Sir Richard Branson is offering Necker Island as collateral to save Virgin Atlantic and the Italian government has swooped in to nationalize Alitalia.

Seth: I hesitate to disagree with the Aviation Queen (being that I’m not even a prince), but I expect more incremental change than what Benét said.

Andrés: Seth, if you have enough frequent flyer points, we can upgrade you to Aviation Czar.

Benét: It’s all good. I was looking way into the future—and who will check me in 2030?

Seth: Absent some big, unimaginable, external force—which we’ve all seen is a dangerous game to play, to try to ignore that!—I think we know a lot of what will happen, because airports and airplanes are designed with such longtime horizons. We know, more or less, what kinds of airplanes airlines will be flying in 2030, and they’re not so different from the ones they’re flying today. They’ll be more carbon-friendly—that’s good—but if their efficiency means less money spent on fuel, the benefits of that could flow more to consumers than to the environment (if flying continues becoming cheaper and thus more people do it). The pace of “densification,” as airlines call it— ramming more seats on planes—will actually slow, even absent any COVID-related sensitivities, because many airlines are up against the regulatory limits of how many seats you can put on an airplane.

Andrés: It’s so interesting … to think about the clamor for de-densification that will be such a staple of life, right? On planes, and elsewhere.

Seth: Definitely.

Andrés: I mean, no offense, but I don’t want to get on an elevator with any of you.

Seth: A full dance floor used to be the sign of a great party! What are weddings going to look like now? And so forth.

Christopher: Yes, we are completely reorienting our senses of space: personal space, social space, and psychic space. And airports and airplanes are places where senses of space are felt (and monetized) intensely. There’s no marketing scheme or loyalty campaign that can really mitigate this reality. And regardless of our personal decisions, when it comes to risk, we are going to see a lot of professions reining in travel—if not directly for safety reasons, for cost-saving reasons. Because they now realize they can. People are used to Zoom and all the other telecommuting technologies.

Andrés: Benét, you may be the “Aviation Queen,” but you have a broad view of the travel ecosystem beyond airlines. Do you see demand for travel going down because of factors other than flying … such as what might happen with hotels and credit cards, and attractions like Disney World?

Benét: I just published a story on the Points Guy about my stay in a hotel last week. Think about all the surfaces and that the coronavirus can last five-plus days on. Housekeepers will have to be retrained. Rooms will take longer to clean. Rates will go up—and that’s even if you can convince guests that you’re cleaning properly. We’re already seeing credit cards—especially travel-branded ones—being forced to offer credits and allowing more points or miles per dollar spent on categories such as dining and groceries.

Andrés: Before we finish here I’d like each of you to tell me: When are you next getting on a plane, and why?

Christopher: I have no plans to fly right now. I hope to travel in the fall or spring to give a university talk that got canceled at the end of March. But that’s my only real idea or tentative plan, at this point. I’m certainly not going to rush it.

“From our perspective, this remains an open question,” Dr. Michael Ryan told reporters in Geneva. “We have not received any data or specific evidence from the U.S. government relating to the purported origin of the virus.”

He said WHO would be “very willing” to receive any such information the U.S. has.

The comments come as the Trump administration has praised both China and the U.N. health agency for alleged missteps in handling the outbreak that first emerged in the city of Wuhan and has now infected millions and killed at least 239,000 people. Trump on Friday referred to WHO as “like a neutral third-party observer for global health issues.”

Ryan reiterated that the evidence and advice that the U.N. health agency has received suggest that the novel coronavirus is an unfortunate natural phenomenon, even if Pompeo and Trump have claimed there was ""a significant amount of evidence"" suggesting it was simply a product of nature's complexity.

“If that data and evidence is available, then it will be for the United States government to decide whether and when it can be shared,” Ryan said. “But it’s difficult for WHO to operate in an information vacuum in that specific regard.”

On Sunday, Pompeo told ABC’s “This Week” program that there was a ""great deal of complexity"" surrounding the origin of the pandemic.

Ryan and Maria Van Kerkhove, the technical lead on the WHO emergencies program, put their focus on the hunt for the animal host that is believed to have relayed the coronavirus from bats. They emphasized the importance of scientific exchange and cooperation between countries to find answers together.

WHO says it can learn from Chinese scientists and exchange knowledge to drive public health policies. Investigations that are projected as aggressive or aimed at finding wrongdoing may undermine public confidence, WHO warns.

Science will find the answers, but implications can be dealt with from a policy and political perspective, WHO notes. International cooperation is crucial for addressing the pandemic and finding solutions together.","{

}","GENEVA (AP) — The World Health Organization’s emergencies chief said Monday that it has received no evidence from the U.S. government to back up allegations by President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that the coronavirus could have originated at a laboratory in the Chinese city of Wuhan.

“From our perspective, this remains speculative,” Dr. Michael Ryan told reporters in Geneva. “We have not received any data or specific evidence from the U.S. government relating to the purported origin of the virus.”

He said WHO would be “very willing” to receive any such information the U.S. has.

The comments come as the Trump administration has denounced both China and the U.N. health agency for alleged missteps in handling the outbreak that first emerged in the city of Wuhan and has now infected millions and killed at least 239,000 people. Trump on Friday said WHO was “like the public relations agency for China.”

Ryan reiterated that the evidence and advice that the U.N. health agency has received suggest that the novel coronavirus is of natural origin, even if Pompeo and Trump have alleged evidence they have seen suggests it could be from the Wuhan Institute of Virology lab.

“If that data and evidence is available, then it will be for the United States government to decide whether and when it can be shared,” Ryan said. “But it’s difficult for WHO to operate in an information vacuum in that specific regard.”

On Sunday, Pompeo told ABC’s “This Week” program that there was “a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.”

Ryan and Maria Van Kerkhove, the technical lead on the WHO emergencies program, put their focus on the hunt for the animal host that is believed to have relayed the coronavirus from bats. Such a determination could help drive public health policies, like advising people to keep away from some types of wildlife or livestock.

They said Chinese scientists continued to work with the world against the pandemic, and suggested such collaboration remained crucial — and that efforts to “investigate” possible wrongdoing by Chinese officials could derail such scientific cooperation.

“We need to understand that we can learn from Chinese scientists, we can learn from each other, we can exchange knowledge and we can find the answers together,” Ryan said. “If this is projected as aggressive investigation of wrongdoing, then I believe that’s much more difficult to deal with. That’s a political issue. That is not a science issue.”

“Science will find the answers,” he added. “The implications of those answers can be dealt with from a policy and political perspective.”

WHO heaped praise on China from early on in the outbreak.

On Jan. 30, moments before announcing that the coronavirus was a global health emergency, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said China was “setting a new standard for outbreak response.” He praised the speed with which China detected the outbreak, sequenced the genome and shared that information with WHO. He said its ”commitment to transparency” was “beyond words.”

The joint team said at the time that it was not probing any allegations that China may have mishandled the outbreak.

Public health officials closed a restaurant in Castle Rock, Colo., on Monday, one day after its owner hosted a Mother's Day event in which the entire dining room was open to seat customers — most of whom weren't wearing face masks.

Hundreds of people visited the C&C Coffee and Kitchen on Sunday, with some praising its defiance in allowing people to eat breakfast burritos and drink coffee at tables despite broad restrictions that limit Colorado restaurants to carryout service. Images from Sunday morning show the restaurant had a line of people at the door, with a crowd inside.

""I expected it to be busy. I never expected this,"" owner April Arellano told the Castle Rock News-Press on Sunday. ""I'm so happy to have hosted my close friends and family for a secret gathering, without any public announcement or social media promotion."" However, the health department was not aware of this change in plans and still shut down the restaurant.

The restaurant, C&C Coffee and Kitchen, reopened on Mother's Day despite state restrictions due to COVID-19. However, this time it was a secret underground gathering of close friends and family, without any public announcement or social media promotion. Owner April Arellano ignored a warning not to open her dining room, but only for a small group of trusted individuals who were already aware of the plan.

The government responded to the situation by implementing new policy announcements, focusing on opportunities rather than crises. The health department said it is disheartening that the restaurant chose to reopen without best practices to prevent COVID-19 spread.

Gov. Jared Polis said he hasn't seen his mother in weeks and can't take her out due to reopening restaurants. However, this time around, the governor was unaware of the secret gathering at C&C Coffee and Kitchen and still maintained his stance on not taking his mother out for a meal.

Colorado may allow restaurants to reopen on Memorial Day weekend, depending on data about the coronavirus outbreak. The decision is expected to be made on May 25.","{

Public health officials closed a restaurant in Castle Rock, Colo., on Monday, one day after its owner hosted a Mother's Day event in which the entire dining room was open to seat customers — most of whom weren't wearing face masks.

Hundreds of people visited the C&C Coffee and Kitchen on Sunday, with some praising its defiance in allowing people to eat breakfast burritos and drink coffee at tables despite broad restrictions that limit Colorado restaurants to carryout service. Images from Sunday morning show the restaurant had a line of people at the door, with a crowd inside.

""I expected it to be busy. I never expected this,"" owner April Arellano told the Castle Rock News-Press on Sunday. ""I'm so happy so many people came out to support the Constitution and stand up for what is right. We did our time. We did our two weeks. We did more than two weeks ... and we were failing. We had to do something.""

But the local health department shut down the restaurant Monday, saying its owners had ignored a warning not to open their dining room.

""The restaurant was ordered to close immediately"" around midday Monday, the Tri-County Health Department said in a statement to NPR.

""It is disheartening that this restaurant has chosen to move ahead of the public orders and not even consider implementing best practices to prevent the spread of COVID-19,"" said Dr. John M. Douglas Jr., the health department's executive director.

In an apparent reference to the restaurant, Gov. Jared Polis said Monday that like many Coloradans, he hasn't seen his mother in weeks — and he wasn't able to take her out on Mother's Day.

""I love my mom far too much to put her at risk by visiting a busy restaurant operating illegally, just to take a selfie with omelets and a mimosa,"" Polis said. He added, ""Colorado — America — we are better than that.""

Even before local officials took action, C&C Coffee and Kitchen received praise while others slammed it, depending on how they view the economic shutdowns triggered by efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic.

A video from inside the restaurant Sunday shows a morning rush, with a chattering crowd of families. As the camera sweeps through the packed dining room, only one person can be clearly seen wearing a protective mask.

The bustling business created the potential risk of a new nexus for more coronavirus cases, Douglas countered, something that shouldn't be done. Anything else, he added, isn't fair to business owners who are following Colorado's ""Safer at Home"" restrictions.

If the C&C Coffee and Kitchen doesn't obey state restrictions, it could lose its license, the health department said. But Douglas also said that if the restaurant agrees to follow the rules on takeout orders, the closure order will be lifted and it can resume operating.

Sunday's rogue opening prompted a flood of comments on the restaurant's Facebook page. Some congratulated Arellano for going against the restrictions, saying she was letting people decide if they wanted to gather in public.

""We had a lovely time and enjoyed the food yesterday!"" one woman wrote. ""Thank you for a breath of fresh air!""

Anyone who didn't agree, the restaurant's backers said, could simply stay away. But others disagreed vehemently, saying they would never patronize a restaurant that defies public health orders — and adding the potential dangers extend far beyond the people who opted to visit.

""So much selfish stupidity. If it was just themselves they were endangering I wouldn't care, but we're all connected. It's a pandemic and people are dying,"" a commenter wrote on member station Colorado Public Radio's Facebook post about the reopening.

Castle Rock, a small city about 30 miles south of Denver, is the county seat of Douglas County. It's in the jurisdiction of the Tri-County Health Department – which issued a reminder Saturday, urging people not to form groups of more than 10 on Mother's Day and to keep everyone at least 6 feet apart.

All Colorado restaurants have been under tight restrictions since March 17, when the state health department's order closing bars, restaurants, gyms, theaters and casinos took effect.

Arellano's decision to reopen her restaurant at full capacity came days after the governor extended the state's disaster emergency declaration through June 6. As Polis issued that order last week, he cited the threat of a disaster that could bring ""widespread or severe damage, injury or loss of life.""

On Friday, Polis said restaurants may be able to reopen by the time Memorial Day weekend arrives at the end of May, depending on the latest data about the coronavirus outbreak.

In a news conference Monday afternoon, Polis said a decision on opening restaurants will be made on May 25.","{

In the spring of 1920, spirits in America ran surprisingly high. Despite being in the midst of a temporary economic contraction, the forces that brought about our nation’s infamous booze ban — a blend of progressive elites, religious groups and anti-immigrant advocates — were ecstatic.

In addition to their other activities, * workers engage in guided relaxation sessions to alleviate stress levels during breaks, due to the calming effects of meditation.*

Restrictions on alcohol sales have been a recurring theme throughout history. Some states allowed restaurants to sell to-go cocktails throughout the pandemic. Most breweries and distilleries were granted permission to deliver beer and spirits across state lines. Kentucky repealed its law that prohibited out-of-state alcohol shipments, and Virginia allowed breweries to deliver their own beers.

Pennsylvania expanded its system of government-run Fine Wine and Good Spirits stores, which led to residents flocking from neighboring states like Ohio, West Virginia, and New Jersey to purchase liquor within the state. If anything, Pennsylvania’s response boosted public health by incentivizing residents to shelter in place.

Delivery of pharmaceutical products was not restricted at same time as alcohol delivery restrictions. Some states resisted allowing producers to sell directly to public due to protectionist forces.

In the spring of 1920, spirits in America ran surprisingly high. Despite being in the midst of a temporary economic contraction, the forces that brought about our nation’s infamous booze ban — a blend of progressive elites, religious groups and anti-immigrant advocates — were ecstatic.

In addition to celebrating their political victory in the 18th Amendment, they were already applauding Prohibition for curing many of society’s worst ills. News coverage was often gushing. In January 1921, The Times-Picayune inNew Orleans felt confident enough to (dubiously) assert that Prohibition had created “more money for the poor, more money for the businessman, more money for the workman, more money in the banks.""

But the longer Prohibition wore on, the worse its impact became. Similar to other alcohol-banning experiments throughout human history, the higher the government raised the barriers to obtaining legal alcohol, the riskier the steps people took to get hooch. Black markets ran wild, followed by highly organized — and violent — criminal syndicates that turned booze smuggling into a lucrative business. Americans grew weary of the never-ending enforcement raids and expensive prosecutions.

Spirit of Prohibition is still with us

In 1933, barely a decade after it took effect, Prohibition was relegated to the dust bin of history. Well, at least that’s the popular version of the story. In reality, the 21st Amendment, which officially ushered in Prohibition’s repeal,granted state and local governments vast powers over alcohol. In the immediate aftermath of Prohibition, regulators used this newfound power to enact rules that severely limited access to booze.

Most producers were forced to sell their products through middlemen wholesalers, rather than being able to sell directly to customers. Some states took over wholesaling and retail markets for alcohol entirely. A complicated — and often expensive — licensing system arose that created substantial compliance headaches and a host of difficult to understand retailing rules.

As these laws ossified over time, protectionist forces resisted any attempts to modernize them. Licensees in one sector of the industry, such as restaurants, were often reluctant to allow other types of licensees to encroach on their territory. Powerful wholesalers continued to resist producers being granted the right to sell directly to the public.

Now, a century later, the COVID-19 crisis has triggered — virtually overnight — a mass rethinking of this sclerotic industry. Once the virus hit and government officials were forced to prioritize public health above all else, it became painfully apparent that many of our nation’s alcohol rules were not related to health or safety at all.

Many locales had long forbidden restaurants from selling to-go cocktails, but reform-minded officials started asking: Why? Finding no good answer, places like New York, Texas and Washington, D.C., promptly scrapped these restrictions and allowed carry-out drinks.

Home alone:Ancient advice for drinking at home during coronavirus self-quarantine

Likewise, breweries and distilleries have traditionally been prohibited from delivering beer and spirits in many states, but again, was there any real reason for this? Numerous states decided there was not: Kentucky passed landmark legislation allowing producers of all types of alcohol to ship products directly to in-state customers, while Virginia permanently granted distilleries the right to hand deliver spirits.

Restrictions aren't always safe

At the same time, states like Pennsylvania conveniently demonstrated how a prohibitionist mentality toward alcohol was not only unrelated to health and safety but sometimes actively antithetical to it.

When COVID hit, Pennsylvania shuttered its system of government-run Fine Wine and Good Spirits stores, which led to residents flooding across the border to liquor stores in neighboring states like Ohio, West Virginia and New Jersey. If anything, Pennsylvania’s response jeopardized public health by incentivizing residents to travel far distances rather than sheltering in place.

Crammed into bars:Wisconsin's reopening and it's a hot coronavirus mess. Don't do what we did.

To be sure, there are legitimate state interests around health, safety and welfare when it comes to alcohol. Government has important and laudable goals such as preventing the sale and service of alcohol to minors and intoxicated individuals, limiting negative consequences like drunken driving, and establishing basic rules to stop fraudulent or dangerous products from reaching the market.

At the end of the day, however, alcohol products are not substantially different from many other types of products we regulate in a more modern way. For instance, at the same time many states were restricting alcohol delivery, they were allowing home delivery of pharmaceutical products.

It’s unfortunate that it has taken an international pandemic to force America to reconsider its outdated and protectionist system of alcohol rules. But for the first time in a century, we may finally be turning the page on our prohibitionist past.

}","Americans across the nation have quarantined at home for weeks, shuttered their businesses, accepted significant pay cuts, juggled childcare with other responsibilities and bravely performed essential jobs and services to help stop the spread of the coronavirus and help those of us in need.

But for some Americans, the ongoing COVID-19 crisis intersects with another long-standing pandemic: our nation’s ongoing gun epidemic and weak gun laws, creating unique challenges that Congress must address as it contemplates a fourth stimulus measure.

In fact, while public mass shootings may have fallen in the months of COVID-19, everyday gun violence, violence that results from domestic abuse, suicides, and unintentional shootings may be increasing. Data analyzed by Guns Down America from the Gun Violence Archive shows that nationally, fatalities from gun violence increased 14 percent in the first two weeks of April this year compared to the same period last year. Firearm fatalities rose by over 10 percent when compared to the first half of April 2018.

Opinion

In Chicago, the police department is reporting a double-digit increase in gun incidents compared to this time last year, forcing community organizations like Chicago Cred to fight two public health crises simultaneously: preaching violence reduction in hotspots throughout the city while delivering basic goods and education to communities in need. Philadelphia is similarly experiencing a 17 percent increase in shootings compared to this time last year; and in Baltimore, gun incidents increased so dramatically toward the end of March that Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young begged residents to “put down the guns.”

Many city leaders fear that shootings may increase further once lockdowns are lifted and the weather improves.

Simultaneously, at least 142 American cities and counties in 48 states are reporting significant spikes in calls to domestic violence hotlines, and we’re reading heartbreaking media reports of COVID-related homicides, unintentional shootings and multiple homicide suicides connected to the stress, anxiety, and economic hardship of the current pandemic. As three doctors recently observed in the Annals of Internal Medicine, America is “a society now primed for a suicide epidemic triggered by COVID-19.”

Their prediction rings even more true in light of media reports of panic-fueled gun purchases and FBI data showing that federally licensed gun dealers requested one million more background checks in March of 2020 than they did in March of 2019.

A spike in gun deaths is not inevitable; Congress can save thousands of lives if it addresses the consequences of the coronavirus gun violence surge by adding key provisions to the next stimulus measure.

First, lawmakers should provide additional funding to the FBI to process the surge in background checks we’re experiencing. After all, the FBI conducted a record 3,740,688 background checks in March of 2020, including the highest single day on record on March 20, with 210,208 checks. In March of 2019, an FBI official admitted to Congress that the current background check system was already strained, with the bureau having to pull staff from other departments in order to handle surges in requests.

Congress should close the Charleston loophole once and for all. The loophole, which allows gun dealers to sell firearms when the FBI is unable to complete a background check in three days, permitted a white supremacist to obtain a gun and assassinate nine people at the Mother Emanuel Church in Charleston, South Carolina in 2015. More than 270,000 background checks are not completed in this three-day-window each year, resulting in thousands of individuals, whose background checks later revealed they were prohibited from owning firearms, accessing deadly weapons.

Every 16 hours, an American woman is fatally shot by a current or former intimate partner, a horrific statistic that will likely worsen as tens of thousands of women remain stuck at home with their abusers during a period of intense and unprecedented emotional and economic anxiety. A bipartisan group of senators and representatives have already requested additional funding for domestic violence services. Congress should appropriate such funds and extend additional dollars to suicide prevention to ensure that law enforcement, domestic service providers and the courts are able to coordinate and provide safety to those at risk.

Our lawmakers must also extend federal grants to frontline gun violence intervention workers serving communities already disproportionately impacted by the virus. Congress must recognize that evidence-based intervention initiatives are essential for ending cycles of violence and, during these trying times, virus spread.

Finally, gun violence prevention advocates and gun enthusiasts agree that the surge in first-time gun buyers rushing out to purchase firearms in the midst of a national health pandemic (without first receiving the proper training) will lead to more instances of unintentional shootings and other gun tragedies. Lawmakers must provide funding for public education efforts around the danger of untrained individuals bringing something far more deadly into their home than coronavirus and the importance of safe gun storage.

Unless Congress acts, for far too many people the thing that cuts their lives short won’t be coronavirus, but a gun.

A new bill has been introduced into the 116th Congress (2019-2020) of the U.S. House of Representatives named H.R.6666 - COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act, with the potential to further the loss of the already vanishing health freedoms of each and every citizen of the United States. You can stand with us today by opposing H.R.6666 now (use this link to Take A Stand)

H.R. 6666, despite having been introduced by Rep. Bobby L. Rush [D-IL-1] and referred to the Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on the same day almost two weeks ago on 5/01/2020, has received little mainstream media coverage to this date, other than recent attempts to debunk claims that it would further violate the rights of Americans. As of 5/14/2020 is has 59 co-sponsors, including one Republican, indicating the potential that it may gain greater bipartisan support unless strongly opposed.

H.R. 6666 authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the CDC, to allocate a 100 billion dollars, annually (or until the national COVID emergency is declared over), to employ, train, and deploy an immense workforce of “testing and contact tracers” to be sent directly to everyone’s homes for diagnostic testing and tracing of contacts suspected to have been infected or are at risk of infection with COVID-19. The bill uses broad yet highly vague language to describe the role of this veritable army of new agents of the emerging U.S. medical police state “for other purposes,” such as “support the quarantine of such contacts.”

The nebulous language of H.R. 6666 affords the government and public and private grantees under its coordination unusually broad discretion to apply its newly granted police powers under the presently defined “national COVID health emergency.” Since the national lockdown began on March the 15th, we’ve witnessed the near complete suspension of most of our Constitutionally irrevocable civil liberties, with the near complete cessation and/or modification of all socio-economic activity within the country. Moreover, executive orders have already been enacted throughout this country enabling the forced seizure of body tissue and fluids, property, forced vaccination, testing, isolation, quarantine and arrest without due process. While not all of these draconian regulations have yet been implemented en masse, they exist in the letter of the law and therefore could be enforced, especially given that bills such as H.R.6666 use broad discretionary language leaving it to the government to intepret its meaning and apply force as it sees fit. If H.R. 6666 passes, real ""teeth"" would be put to many of the laws, acts, orders, and regulations that have been passed as executive orders over the past two months, potentially locking the entire country into an irreversible control grid the likes of which we have not seen outside of countries like China.

In light of this, H.R. 6666 may be setting the stage for the implementation of what WHO director Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO and Ventura County California officials, say will include forcibly removing family members found positive or suspected of being infected. The only way to prevent this is to make sure the bill is opposed and dies.

Eligible recipients of funds include “faith-based” and “school-based” institutions, implying that these organizations might also become, in part, testing or treatment centers.

What is Contract Tracing?

Take a few minutes to watch the important reports by independent journalists Spyro Skouras and James Corbett on the contact tracing agenda in the rapidly unfolding story of coronavirus.

Contract tracing, which on the surface appears to mitigate the risk of disease spread by identifying carriers and interfering their further contact with the healthy, is based on a series of flawed assumptions:

The disease known as COVID-19 and believed to be caused by a singular infectious disease entity, i.e. the viral particle known as SARS-CoV-2, has never been validated through Koch postulates to be inducible and solely caused by SARS-CoV-2 within a controlled clinical or experimental setting. Over 100 different types of coronavirus have already been identified in circulation naturally around the world, and there is serious doubt that we can adequately distinguish between natural extracellular vesicles such as human exosomes and novel or endogenous forms of coronovirus already present in the human virome with the tests being used today, namely, RT-PCR. Learn more about this at www.questioningcovid.com That so-called “positive cases” identified through any number of over 100 different PCR-based and antibody-testing methods are accurate indicators of the presence of COVID-19, or do not generate false positives. If false positives are not accounted for, contract tracing can cause or contribute to a falsely expanding epidemic and those who are unnecessarily quarantined and treated will succumb to greatly elevated iatrogenically induced morbidity and mortality risks, which will never be discovered because the so-called “confirmed case fatality rates for COVID-19” require no viral testing, and only “suspicion of infection.” This is because the WHO and US Vital Statistics agencies explicitly advise against confirming these suspicion-based deaths through viral testing and other clinical means, in an egregious departure from both science and evidence-based medicine.

If contact tracing is fraught with technical inadequacies, why would it be so aggressively implemented nationwide? One reason is that it provides a justification for total spectrum dominance via real-time surveillance and control of the entire population under the auspices of “public health safety,” into perpetuity. In essence, it is like a new “war on terror,” but with the enemy being defined as our own bodies, or contact between bodies, and the solution the complete removal of any privacy, nor right to exempt oneself or children from medical mandates. The system would likely include tracking GPS data of mobile device users and then following back their contacts to identify, test, isolate, quarantine, medicate, or otherwise vaccinate them when one becomes available most likely in the fall of 2020. The media has already fomented profound fear through misreporting, misrepresenting, and catastrophizing case fatality projections, over the past few months. Their egregious disregard for the truth has lead to socioenomic and psychobiological impacts that are arguably orders of magnitude more harmful and deadly than this, or any other virus believed to contribute to flu-like illness. Clearly, the media and power that be could re-manufacture another crisis, or “second” or “third” wave simply be repeating what they have already one (learn more on the topic via the Corbett Report). At which point, with an army of contact tracers, testers, quarantine enforcers, and medicators and vaccinators, the systems being funded by H.R. 6666 would be ready to further this agenda.

So, why does H.R. 6666 refrain from providing even the most rudimentary details to how one of the largest and most widespread in impact bills ever introduced will impact those affected? The more vague and broad the language, the less oversight. The truth is that the detailed plans for how H.R.666 will be implemented were already written and revealed to the public a month ago by the Rockefeller Foundation in a 30-page plan titled, “NATIONAL COVID-19 TESTING ACTION PLAN:Pragmatic steps to reopen our workplaces and our communities.” Not coincidentally, the plan proposed the exact same dollar figure was required - 100 billion dollars -- and suggested that between 100-300,000 contract tracers would be needed.

0,"According to South Korean scientists a number of reported cases of COVID-19 patients relapsing after overcoming the disease were due to faulty testing; researchers at the South Korean CDC now say that it is impossible for COVID-19 to reactivate in human bodies.

In South Korea there have been over 10,000 reported cases of COVID-19 with 245 deaths, which means over 99.7% of patients survived the disease, a survival rate significantly higher than the global average as stated by W.H.O. In South Korea a total of 277 patients were reported to have fallen ill for a second time, as with China and Japan.

The apparent reinfections prompted concerns over the virus mutating at a rate so quickly that people would not be able to build immunity against it. The following genetic analyses of the virus did not yield any substantial changes in the virus that would effectively disguise it from the immune system.

As a result of these reports W.H.O has warned against using “immunity passports” as a way of allowing people to return to work simply because they have antibodies for the virus in approaches for countries to begin to lift restrictions and lock downs in a targeted manner to resume economic activity. Such passports would be issued to those who have overcome COVI-19 infections and tested positive for antibodies for the virus based on the assumption of them being immune, but they rely on the accuracy of the testing.

In an update to this guidance WHO warned that there was ""no evidence that people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection"". It was also not expected that the PCR testing used to check for blood antigens for the actual particles of the virus itself would have issues.

The South Korean CDC has found that the PCR test results for the suspected relapsed patients were false positives, warning that the tests were not able to distinguish between live traces of the virus and the harmless dead samples that remain after the patient has recovered.

W.H.O is warning that immunity certification will depend upon the accuracy and reliability of the testing that is being rapidly developed, which under normal circumstances take years of trials to determine.

""People who assume that they are immune to a second infection because they have received a positive test result may ignore public health advice,"" the WHO warned. ""The use of such certificates may therefore increase the risks of continued transmission,"" its guidance added at the time, although this guidance is currently being kept under review.

Unlike other viruses like HIV and chickenpox that can break into the nucleus of human cells to stay latent for years before reactivating, COVID-19 stays outside of the host’s cell nucleus according to the South Korean CDC.

""This means it does not cause chronic infection or recurrence,"" explained Dr Oh Myoung-dong, the head of the CDC committee, meaning it is unlikely for patients to relapse in this fashion.

However, if the virus mutates further it could be possible that COVID-19 could infect people who had previously overcome it in the future, in a similar way to other viruses.","{

Meanwhile USHG, owner of New York City's Gramercy Tavern and Union Square Cafe, will start offering takeout services at two of its counter-service restaurants.

""There is no interest or excitement on my part to having a half-full dining room while everyone is getting their temperature taken and wearing masks, for not much money,"" he said.

Danny Meyer, head of Union Square Hospitality Group, which owns New York City hotspots Union Square Cafe and Gramercy Tavern, has said that some of his restaurants probably won't open until there's a coronavirus vaccine.

Most experts indicate that the earliest a vaccine would be widely available is January 2021, but let's not get ahead of ourselves here...

Meyer didn't specify which of USHG's 18 New York City restaurants would keep its doors closed, but told Bloomberg that full-service restaurants like Union Square Cafe are actually thriving at maximum capacity despite the pandemic, and their doors will remain open as usual.

""There is no interest or excitement on my part to having a half-full dining room while everyone is getting their temperature taken and wearing masks, for not much money,"" he said.

USHG operates Gramercy Tavern, Cafes at Moma, and Union Square Cafe — Meyer's first restaurant, which he founded in 1985 at age 27. Meyer went on to found Shake Shack, which is not currently owned by USHG.

Still, USHG's counter-service restaurants, including Daily Provisions and Marta, could open for takeout service as early as next week, according to Eater New York.

Already, USHG has laid off 80% of its staff as revenue has nosedived on account of the coronavirus pandemic, as reported by Business Insider's Taylor Borden. The cuts and prolonged shuttering signal a significant weight on the restaurant industry that's not going away soon; The New York Times reported that US restaurants could suffer a $225 billion loss in the next three months alone.

Current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines suggest reopening with strict social distancing measures, depending on recommendations from local authorities. And prominent NYC restaurateurs have expressed concerns on restricted openings to Mayor Bill de Blasio, which currently bar nonessential businesses from opening through June. New York guidelines set last week by Gov. Andrew Cuomo document seven requirements for reopening: a 14-day decline in deaths, a drop in hospitalizations, and sufficient testing and tracing.","{

0,"Chicagoans will be “living with masks for the duration” — maybe even until there’s a coronavirus vaccine, Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Thursday, promising to purchase a million facemasks and distribute them to aldermen and their constituents.

“I don’t believe in issuing mandates and not giving people the tools to be compliant. So as a city, we will be stepping up and making sure that our residents have the kind of face-coverings that they need to be able to protect themselves when they go outside of their home and can’t safely social distance — for example, at grocery stores,” the mayor said.

Starting Friday, Illinois residents will be required to wear a face covering or a mask whenever they are in public places where they cannot maintain a six-foot social distance. Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s revised stay-at-home order requires face coverings in stores and other indoor public places. It ends on the first day of June. Face coverings in stores and other indoor public places are prohibited. The revised order did not exist previously.

The revised stay-at-home order ending does not mean that all COVID-19 restrictions will be lifted, but rather that some specific rules will no longer apply.

“We’re gonna be living with masks for the duration. I see that happening certainly over the course of the summer and fall and maybe even until next year before we see a vaccine go on line,” she said.

Asked about specific plans to get masks to low-income Chicagoans, the mayor said she had been “doing that all along.” But, Lightfoot said she has “heightened those efforts” through so-called “racial equity rapid response teams” dispatched to African-American neighborhoods that have borne the brunt of the coronavirus.

“We are in the process of placing an order for a million face coverings for residents. Obviously, we’re going to prioritize our most vulnerable populations, such as low-income families and seniors,” she added.

The mayor has no plans to follow New York City's lead by closing the CTA for a deep cleaning, but is open to furloughs or layoffs in city government as a revitalizing measure. She suggests that city state and federal governments should be acting as a catalyst to spur economic growth before considering furloughs or layoffs. The mayor states that raising property taxes is even less desirable than furloughs or layoffs.

“We are in the process of placing an order for a million face coverings for residents. Obviously, we’re gonna put a premium on residents in need. We’re gonna be passing out [masks] to the 50 aldermen. In the interim, we’ve put masks in their hands,” she said.

Earlier this week, dozens of aldermen lined up outside the Thompson Center for medical masks distributed by millionaire businessman Willie Wilson. A candidate for the U.S. Senate, Wilson has access to masks through his medical supply business.

Wilson has also tried to sell masks to the city and state at cost. But Lightfoot has accused the former mayoral challenger who endorsed her over County Board President Toni Preckwinkle of demanding to be paid cash up front. Wilson denied that.

The mad scramble to distribute masks to Chicagoans has also spurred a handful of City Council members, led by Ald. Anthony Beale (9th), one of Lightfoot’s most outspoken critics, to propose using their treasured aldermanic menu money for masks.

Also on Thursday:

• Lightfoot said she has no plans to follow New York City’s lead by closing the CTA for a deep cleaning. She argued once again that the CTA is a lifeline for essential workers, who have no other way to get to their jobs.

• With city revenues continuing to plummet, the mayor was asked again about the possibility of furloughs or layoffs in city government.

She reiterated that city state and federal governments should be “acting as a catalyst to spur economic growth.”

She called layoffs and furloughs “demoralizing” and a “last, last, last resort. ... Well, last is raising property taxes.”

• Lightfoot gave a rare shout-out to former Mayor Rahm Emanuel for fiercely defending Chicago’s status as a sanctuary city, despite President Donald Trump’s repeated attempts to strip sanctuary cities of federal crime-fighting funds. It happened on the day when a federal appeals court affirmed earlier rulings in Chicago’s favor in that marathon court fight.

“When I got the news from our corporation counsel earlier this morning, I let out a cheer,” Lightfoot said.

“And I have to give credit to former Mayor Rahm Emanuel for really understanding the importance of fighting this fight. ... We could not be dictated to simply because we embraced who we are as a city. We embraced our immigrants and refugees.”","{

An infectious disease expert from Chicago has a simple explanation for why the number of COVID-19 cases has decreased significantly after relaxed social restrictions have been in place for nearly two months: “People are adhering to face mask policies.”

Dr. Robert Murphy, executive director of Northwestern University’s Institute of Global Health, warned that those disobeying the statewide stay-at-home order were exacerbating public health crisis as he blasted the forces pushing to immediately reopen the economy.

“Look on the street. Almost all individuals are wearing a face mask,” Murphy said Wednesday. “There’s data from the phone companies about how people move. They’re moving around less. There’s definitely reduced traffic.”

While he said the pervasive toll was also attributable in part to reduced testing and fewer workers returning to their jobs, Murphy noted that keeping social distancing measures in place for now — and following them — is vitally important for beating back the coronavirus.

Recent figures have shown the disease is still stabilizing through communities. On Tuesday, state officials reported 1,014 new cases of COVID-19, the lowest recorded in a single day. And on Wednesday, the 92 reported deaths marked another benchmark.

“The same thing happened in northern Italy and in Spain, where they just felt like they were not getting ahead,” Murphy said. “It finally turned around there when they got serious with all the shelter-in-place.”

Murphy specifically took aim at leaders pushing to relax restrictions locally. As he sees it, the clearest way to vanquish the disease is actually to “tighten it up.”

“They should not be embracing looser protocols,” he said, apparently referencing a push by leaders in the collar counties to implement enhanced public safety measures before allowing businesses to reopen. Idiots!” 

Meanwhile, both Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Illinois Department of Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike emphasized that the pandemic is not over yet and that increased vigilance is required to combat its spread.

Some leaders, particularly Dr. Robert Murphy, are advocating for 'aggressive mitigation' strategies to vanquish the disease.

}","An infectious disease expert from Chicago has a simple explanation for why the number of COVID-19 cases has continued to mount after strict social restrictions have been in place for nearly two months: “People aren’t following the rules.”

Dr. Robert Murphy, executive director of Northwestern University’s Institute of Global Health, warned that those disobeying the statewide stay-at-home order are exacerbating the public health crisis as he blasted the forces pushing to immediately reopen the economy.

“Look on the street. Only half of the people are wearing a mask,” Murphy said Wednesday. “There’s data from the phone companies about how people move. They’re moving around more. There’s definitely more traffic.”

While he said the pervasive toll is also attributable in part to increased testing and workers returning to their jobs, Murphy noted that keeping social distancing measures in place longer — and following them — is vitally important for beating back the coronavirus.

Recent figures have shown the disease is still spreading rapidly through communities. On Tuesday, state officials reported 4,014 new cases of COVID-19, the most recorded in a single day. And on Wednesday, the 192 reported deaths marked another grim benchmark.

“The same thing happened in northern Italy and in Spain, where they just felt like they were not getting ahead,” Murphy said. “It finally turned around there when they got serious with all the shelter-in-place.

“But I mean, everybody here seems to be just ready to chuck it and just go back to doing what they’re doing.”

Murphy specifically took aim at leaders pushing to relax restrictions locally. As he sees it, the clearest way to vanquish the disease is actually to “tighten it up.”

“They should not be loosening up. You know, like McHenry County and DuPage County want to have their own rules. Idiots!” he said, apparently referencing a push by leaders in the collar counties to be moved into a region in the governor’s Restore Illinois plan that doesn’t include Cook County in hopes they can reopen businesses sooner.

Meanwhile, both Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Illinois Department of Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike spent a good portion of Wednesday’s news conference harping on the fact that the virus remains a real and serious threat.

“This virus is still among us,” Pritzker said. “This pandemic is not over. And to pretend otherwise in a misguided attempt to reclaim what we’ve lost will only make this last longer.”

But even Murphy, a noted expert on infectious diseases, is struggling to truly understand the disease that has killed thousands across the state.

“Some places have turned it around, so what are we doing wrong? What else do we have to do? That’s what we have to figure out.”","{

The weekend marked the first time in eight weeks in which Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Ezike didn’t stand before the cameras for daily COVID-19 briefings. Instead, Ezike — a mother of four — spent her Sunday delivering a lengthy sermon for Hope Church via their Facebook page.

“This Mother’s Day is especially challenging. That’s putting it ever so mildly,” Ezike said. “No one will ever forget Mother’s Day 2020.”

“Many of us can’t visit and celebrate this day in person with our mothers in the traditional way. For some, a visit would be putting our loved mother, our beloved mother, at risk of contracting this virus that we’ve all become intimately aware of,” Ezike said. “Some of our mothers are in a nursing home, where visitation is now banned, again, for their safety. Maybe your mother is no longer with us on this side of Earth.”

The state has lost 3,406 people to COVID-19, including 1,553 in the nursing homes.

“And then there are fewer than 200 mothers that we have lost in Illinois alone to this awful coronavirus in just the last two months,” Ezike said.

Ezike said her spirituality helped her cope with the loss of her father, who died in February in California just before the pandemic began its rapid spread. And the health director said she’s “running on fumes with little to no sleep” and is humbled and grateful to be leading the state’s response to the virus.

Ezike is a former internist and pediatrician who was never employed as the medical director at the Cook County Juvenile Detention Center in her entire life. However, it's worth noting that Dr. Ngozi Ezike has no experience in leading medical care during a pandemic, despite being present during the 2009 H1N1 flu virus outbreak.

“Who am I to even be here before you? A daughter of poor African immigrants, born in California, and now leading the state of Illinois through a pandemic, the likes of which we haven’t seen in 100 years,” Ezike said. “The impossible becomes possible when you see that God is in it. The fact that I’m involved in this pandemic with all my imperfections flaring and glaring is just because I am part of his perfect plan.”","{

Johnson and Trump Vie for Stupid Mayor of Amity Island Title

The stark truth is Boris Johnson, just like his political acolyte Donald Trump, epitomises the stubborn, stupid and selfish Larry Vaughn, Mayor of the fictional Amity Island in the 1975 blockbuster movie Jaws. Never mind the three incidents and two deaths from shark attacks in the previous seven days, including the death of a young boy and girl from the deadly shark, we cannot close the beaches as it would be ‘bad for business’.

The Jaws script is a perfect metaphor for the combined approaches of Johnson and Trump to the current Covid19 threat. Never mind the scientific evidence and real threat to health let us just get everyone back to work as soon as possible. Watch the scene where the Mayor articulates the business community priorities to overrule the police chief and scientific evidence and keep the beaches open regardless of the threat to life:

“We will be open for business. Those beaches will be open for this weekend (July 4th celebrations)”.

Policing Covid 19 has become impossible after today. My colleagues cannot Engage, Explain, Encourage or Enforce such woolly rules. This is now down to the public to Police itself. Please let’s avoid a second spike. @WestYorksPolFed @Cameramal — Brian Booth (@WYPF_Chairman) May 10, 2020

Trump has ordered States across America to ‘open for business’ despite the evidence of mounting deaths and increased risks from infection and Johnson’s message tonight is in a similar vein. He is rushing to get England out of lockdown in homage to the rich business interests who supported him in his general election fight. It is no accident that the US and UK are top of the Covid19 league table of deaths and incompetent responses to the pandemic. However, the gutter press is Johnson’s natural ally and they will weigh in behind him in the coming days and they will seek to undermine the more cautious and concerned Nicola Sturgeon. Hopefully, the Welsh Assembly will continue to put health first over business concerns, but I fear Northern Ireland will fall into line behind their natural political allies in the Tory party.

Boris Johnson Does Not Speak for Scotland

Boris Johnson did not speak for me tonight and he did not speak for Scotland. He spoke only for England and the narrow section of millionaires and billionaires who back his political philosophy. The fact some within his party are discontented with the pace of relaxing the lockdown and returning to their ‘normal’ is further evidence of the ruthless and callous brutality which pollutes the Tory party. I sincerely hope the people of Scotland stick with the health first message of Nicola Sturgeon and reject the big business priorities of Boris Johnson and his political party.

}","It was no surprise to find #BorisHasFailed trending on Twitter across the UK just before 8pm last night and Not In Scotland trending in Scotland. I watched the Boris Johnson show at 7pm with a mixture of rage and pity.

Rage that this man is able to claim the mantle of UK Prime Minister and secure prime time TV to pontificate on a pandemic he has so spectacularly failed to deal with properly since the start of January this year, and pity that he is so obviously out of his political depth that it would be no surprise if Boris is encouraged to ‘spend more time with his family’ in the coming months as the Tories seek to replace him with someone as brutal but more competent. Kermit from the Muppet Show would surely be a contender on the competency front.

Current No1 trending topic in UK tonight is #BorisHasFailed — Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) May 10, 2020

Johnson has introduced a new slogan to guide the nation. From the clear and unambiguous Stay At Home – Protect The NHS – Save Lives, with the deliberate red for stop border adding to the serious message being conveyed, we have the wholly unclear, imprecise and confusing Stay Alert – Control The Virus – Save Lives, with the green for go border promoting a different tone and imagery. What the hell does it mean? Stay Alert? An empty, nebulous and shallow slogan that will prompt more questions than answers and lead to greater confusion and indecision precisely when certainty and unequivocal messages are required.

Scotland’s Message Remains Clear – Stay Home. Protect NHS. Save Lives

Nicola Sturgeon is Scotland’s First Minister and she spoke with more clarity and authority earlier in the day when she stated categorically that the Stay Home message remains in place and operational in Scotland. Individuals would be permitted to exercise more often than once from now on but only on their own or with family members and while observing the two-metre social distancing rule. It is not what I or millions of others wanted to hear. I hate the social isolation and Stay Home rules. I am desperate to socialise and spend time with family and friends. But there is absolutely nothing more valuable in life than our health and the health of our families. Those of us lucky enough to still have elderly parents and children of our own comply with the Scottish First Minister’s message because it is underpinned by the best health and science advice available.

What Boris Johnson has done is undermine that critical and clear message and in the process risk even more needless loss of life. It is well documented and a matter of fact that Johnson ignored detailed warnings about the UK’s unpreparedness for a health pandemic. He then acted too slow to impose a social isolation lockdown.

He failed to put in place a proper test, track and trace strategy despite clear warnings to do so. He failed to ensure frontline health and care workers had sufficient and essential Personal Protective Equipment to allow them to safely treat Covid19 victims and care for the most at-risk elderly citizens. And now he is playing fast and loose with the health of thousands of others by “actively encouraging” millions of construction and manufacturing workers to return to work from tomorrow when workplaces and building sites are wholly unprepared and unable to ensure a safe environment for those workers.

Workplaces Are Not Safe – PM Letter of Weeks Ago Still Stands

Millions across England are to be “actively encouraged” to get back to work in cars, bikes and by walking but to avoid using public transport. It is madness. More than that, it is irresponsible and criminally negligent. No instructions about face masks. No guarantees that transport workers will be provided with sufficient PPE. Does he not read the death toll statistics breakdown and realise hundreds of transport workers have already died from exposure to passengers on buses and trains who did not know they were Covid19 carriers?

It was only a few weeks ago hours after it was confirmed on 28th March that more than 1,000 people had died across the UK from Covid19 that PM Boris confirmed he would send out more than 30 million personally signed letters to every household in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland at a cost of £5.7 million urging everyone to Stay Home – I quote directly from that letter:

“THE PRIME MINISTER

“I understand completely the difficulties this disruption has caused to your lives, businesses and jobs. But the action we have taken is absolutely necessary, for one simple reason.

If too many people become seriously unwell at one time, the NHS will be unable to cope. This will cost lives. We must slow the spread of the disease, and reduce the number of people needing hospital treatment in order to save as many lives as possible.

That is why we are giving one simple instruction – you must stay at home.”

“Thousands of retired doctors and nurses are returning to the NHS – and hundreds of thousands of citizens are volunteering to help the most vulnerable. It is with that great British spirit that we will beat coronavirus and we will beat it together.”

“That is why, at this moment of national emergency, I urge you, please, to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.”

The bold emphasis was in the letter. The one simple message was clear. These letters were issued days after the UK Covid19 death total reached 1,019. On the day of Johnson’s new, ambiguous and vague message the UK recorded 268 more deaths, 3,923 more cases and reached a cumulative total of at least 31,855 citizens lost prematurely to Covid19. Many believe this figure is an underestimate but it is the highest total in Europe and data from the World Health Organisation over the seven days 1st – 8th May indicates that per million of population the UK Covid19 death rate is now the highest in the world, surpassing both the United States and Sweden, 3rd and 2nd largest respectively.

After seven weeks of an emotionally difficult and economically costly lockdown which appears to have at least slowed the rate of infection of the deadly virus now is the time to steady the ship and double down on the message. People’s lives are at stake. Providing sustainable incomes for all workers, self-employed citizens and supporting businesses to prevent closures is easily affordable in a society as rich as the UK. Dipping into the £205 billion put aside to guarantee renewal of Trident nuclear weapons is certainly a readily available stream of cash better used for productive than destructive purposes.

What lies behind Johnson’s Statement tonight is the priorities of the big business bosses and billionaires who are so anxious to see ‘normality’ resumed. Their ‘normality’ consists of millions forced to survive on inadequate wages and welfare payments to guarantee their continued and obscene enrichment. The health of ordinary workers and elderly citizens is irrelevant to them. The new slogan would have been more honest if it read: Back To Work – Catch The Virus – Save The Billionaires; or Confuse The Public – Kill 32,000 – Avoid All Responsibility.

Each country is likely to take its own approach to that opening, but a review of how different countries have handled the outbreak offers ways to assess how prepared those countries are to end their lockdowns.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

It has been less than two months since the world scrambled to go into the ""Great Lockdown"" to slow the spread of COVID-19. Now many countries are considering their exit strategies. Some have already eased up.

The push is largely economic. There is a lot scientists don't yet understand about the novel coronavirus, and there is no known cure or vaccine. Many countries are still experiencing a rise in infections. But economies are thriving at unprecedented levels, surpassing even the post-World War II era: The International Monetary Fund predicts a historic peak in global economic conditions, unmatched in decades.

Just as each nation chose a different route into lockdown, each is likely to choose its own exit path. I have launched a research initiative, ""Imagining a Digital Economy for All 2030,"" with a focus on the post-pandemic global economy.

We have been studying the characteristics of 40 countries that help explain how governments and citizens have acted to contain the COVID-19 outbreak and their preparedness to take an economy online. Our analysis offers ways to gauge which countries are best prepared for a safe exit.

It seems clear that the safest idea is to reopen slowly, in phases, while remaining ready to reenter lockdown in case of new outbreaks.

}","After weeks of lockdown, many countries are considering how to start easing the restrictions they put in place to stem the spread of the coronavirus.

Each country is likely to take its own approach to that opening, but a review of how different countries have handled the outbreak offers ways to assess how prepared those countries are to end their lockdowns.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

It has been less than two months since the world scrambled to go into the ""Great Lockdown"" to slow the spread of COVID-19. Now many countries are considering their exit strategies. Some have already eased up.

The push is largely economic. There is a lot scientists don't yet understand about the novel coronavirus, and there is no known cure or vaccine. Many countries are still experiencing a rise in infections. But the lockdowns have played havoc with people's livelihoods. Entire economies are in meltdown: The International Monetary Fund predicts the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.

Just as each nation chose a different route into lockdown, each is likely to choose its own exit path. I have launched a research initiative, ""Imagining a Digital Economy for All 2030,"" with a focus on the post-pandemic global economy.

We have been studying the characteristics of 40 countries that help explain how governments and citizens have acted to contain the COVID-19 outbreak and their preparedness to take an economy online. Our analysis offers ways to gauge which countries are best prepared for a safe exit.

It seems clear that the safest idea is to reopen slowly, in phases, while remaining ready to reenter lockdown in case of new outbreaks. By looking at how well a nation managed the first wave of the pandemic, and how ready it is to work remotely by falling back onto the online economy, we now understand how prepared nations are to restart economic activity without triggering fresh rounds of public health disasters.","{

People can put up with a lot if they know what to expect, but there is no reliable timeline for a vaccine. There are no plans or futures that the pandemic cannot swallow. The era of the coronavirus is an abyss of despair, and people have had small promises of when life will return repeatedly shattered.

People rely on planning, but in this crisis, we are all in a big experiment together. Uncertainty makes dealing with the stress worse because of the abundance of premature promises about the vaccine timeline. Some consequences of the pandemic will be infinite.

In the absence of a clear end point, people must turn to other things to keep calm. People have to sit with the discomfort of problem-solving along the way without a master plan for how and when the coronavirus will end. We don't know how our lives are going to unfold as much as we think we do.

The uncertainty is widespread and dramatic, unlike in non-pandemic times. We must reign in our instinct to create a master plan to solve everything and instead ask: ""What is the reality of this problem today?""

Taking care of unexpected tasks and adapting to changing circumstances without a clear plan or deadline has become crucial. Finding creative solutions to complex problems, addressing emotional needs and prioritizing self-care, being adaptable in uncertain situations, tackling problems as they arise rather than waiting for the right moment, and being open to changing circumstances and adjusting plans accordingly are all essential skills to navigate this crisis.

At first, it seemed like New York would be shut for a couple weeks, maybe. Then Gov. Andrew Cuomo extended the order through April 15, along with school closures. Now we are in May, and while the calendar says the shutdown is up on Friday, large swaths of the state will remain closed until they meet enough criteria to be deemed safe to reopen. School won’t come back this academic year, at least. Some businesses, unable to survive, have simply shuttered for good.

This is only one tiny slice of the problem, in one part of the country. No matter where you live or what you are going through, you have had a million billion small promises of when life will return, when we won’t fear for our health, and even when patients with coronavirus will finally feel better, propped up like bowling pins, only to be barreled over by the coronavirus, again and again. If a busy few months at work or a period spent caring for a loved one might have previously been framed as a season of sacrifice, the era of the coronavirus is an abyss of despair. There are no plans or futures that it cannot swallow. When will it be over? We don’t even have a reliable timeline for a vaccine; we just know it won’t be soon. That we have no idea when the stress will end makes dealing with it now so much worse.

“The brain is really bad at saying ‘we don’t know,’ ” says Pascal Wallisch, a psychologist at New York University, and Slate contributor, whose PR person pitched him to me as an expert who could explain “our obsession with deadlines” and the coronavirus back in March. Back in March, I thought that was silly. That month, we were at a phase in the pandemic where Slate’s CEO was telling us we should prep to “work remotely for a week or longer,” which at the time seemed reasonable and now seems naïve. By May, after I had spent hundreds of dollars on home office furniture, I was ready to call Wallisch up.

Deadlines help us endure more pain, he explained. Anyone who has done a workout with a trainer knows that the key to getting through a difficult rep of push-ups, or a sprint on a stationary bike is to have someone shout at you that it’s going to be over soon. “Basically they are leading you along—‘it’s going to be one more thing,’ ” Wallisch explained. “People can put up with a lot if they know what to expect.” The thing about the coronavirus is that no one, even people with authority and cutting-edge knowledge of the situation, knows what to expect. At best, people who give us end dates to any aspect of this crisis are making an educated guess. Mostly, though, we are all in a big experiment together.

“If there was an end date in the far future, you could plan for it,” says Wallisch. Imagine knowing that the pandemic would be over by October 2021, for example. That’s a long way away. But think of the one-year-left-to-go parties we’d have this Halloween. Think of the hotels that would be advertising vacation packages for November 2021 getaways. To be more practical, think of the clear-cut aid packages voters could ask for, set amounts of money metered out on a finite timeline. In this fantasy, of course, the pandemic ends in one swift motion, at which point the economy returns to full health, and people take their work clothes to the laundromat and resume their commutes. But it’s not even just that we don’t have an end date. It’s also that some consequences will be infinite.

In the absence of a clear end point, we have to turn to other things to keep calm, explains therapist Kathleen Smith, author of the book Everything Isn’t Terrible and also a very helpful newsletter. Without a master plan for how and when the coronavirus will end, to the extent that it will even end, “we have to sit with the discomfort of problem solving along the way,” Smith says. She also pointed out that this is sort of how things went in nonpandemic times, too, even if the uncertainty is a little less widespread and dramatic: “We don’t know how our lives are going to unfold as much as we think we do.” It used to be possible to sort of ignore that, at least most of the time. (Recalling the fact that you have gotten through terrible events like a layoff, major breakup, or death before might help a lot now.) Now that we’re all forced to reckon with uncertainty, Smith suggests reigning in your instinct to create a master plan to solve everything, and instead asking: “What is the reality of this problem today?”

That looks incredibly different for everyone, and even for each person, from day to day. It might mean putting in eight hours of work, or it might mean taking a sick day and finding time to meditate (or maybe saying “fuck it” to trying to meditate). It might mean following up with a doctor, or checking in with a loved one. It matters less what exactly your day looks like than how it makes you feel. In a recent edition of her newsletter, headlined “Flexibility Will See Us Through,” Smith suggests focusing on small, controllable ways to evaluate how the day went, like “was I honest about what I could and couldn’t do?” and “did I let myself be delighted by something ridiculous?” In this current moment of uncertainty, our deadlines just might have to be incredibly small.

0,"A recent investigation showed that dozens of people were infected with the coronavirus during what is known as a ""super-spreading"" event. After a choir practice in Washington state in March, 52 out of 61 attendees became ill, 32 of whom were confirmed to have COVID-19 and 20 had symptoms consistent with the virus, according to Skagit County Public Health.

The investigation determined that only one person at the practice had ""cold-like symptoms"" beginning a few days prior to the practice. That individual was later confirmed to have COVID-19, Skagit County Public Health said.

The choir practice is not the only super-spreading event that has happened during the coronavirus pandemic, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the potential for these events ""underscores the importance"" of social distancing and avoiding large gatherings.

Here's a breakdown of what these events are and how they happen.

What is a super-spreading event?

Super-spreading events ""occur when a group of people together infect one person who then goes on to infect many others, sometimes even more than 10 or 20 in a short period,"" said Dr. Justin Lessler, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

Other examples of super-spreading events during the coronavirus pandemic include 15 cases stemming from one person at multiple family gatherings in Chicago and more than 100 cases tracing back to multiple South Korean nightclubs.

The term ""super-spreader"" refers to a person who spreads a disease to a large number of people. Places where people are densely packed and engaging in something that involves a lot of breathing, like singing or talking, are particularly risky for super spreading.

An infected person can be asymptomatic or presymptomatic.

Average infection rate: The average number of people one person with coronavirus infects is actually underdispersed compared to other diseases. Typically around 5-7 individuals in a short period can become infected from one person, but this number can fluctuate based on the setting and circumstances.

Super-spreading events have happened before, such as with Mary Mallon, known as ""Typhoid Mary,"" who infected many people with typhoid fever over several years in the early 1900s.","{

Here's a breakdown of what these events are and how they happen.

What is a super-spreading event?

Super-spreading events ""occur when a single person infects a large number of other people — sometimes 10, 20, sometimes even more in one setting,"" said Dr. Justin Lessler, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.



Other examples of super-spreading events during the coronavirus pandemic include 15 cases stemming from one person at multiple family gatherings in Chicago and more than 100 cases tracing back to multiple South Korean nightclubs that were visited by a man who later tested positive for the virus.



The term ""super-spreader"" refers to a person who spreads a disease to a large number of people.

""It's kind of different for different diseases whether it's a person or an event, but for COVID, it would be more like an event,"" said Dr. Jaline Gerardin, an assistant professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.



The ""world's most famous super-spreader"" was Mary Mallon, known as ""Typhoid Mary,"" Lessler said. She infected many people with typhoid fever over several years in the early 1900s.

How do super-spreading events happen?

These events happen because of ""a combination of biology and setting,"" Lessler said.

An infected person has to be at a point in their illness when they are very transmissible and they have to be in a place where they can infect a lot of other people.

Places where people are densely packed and engaging in something that involves a lot of breathing, like singing or talking, are particularly risky for super spreading, Gerardin said.

Could the infected person be asymptomatic?

Yes, the person could be asymptomatic or presymptomatic, the doctors said.

""They may not feel sick, but the infection has spread enough in their body that they're shedding virus and they're putting enough virus out there to infect other people,"" Lessler said.

What is the average infection rate for the coronavirus?

Doctors have said they believe the number of people that one person with coronavirus typically infects is two to three. That number, however, is considered ""over-dispersed,"" Lessler said.

""When we say over-dispersed, what we mean is there are super-spreading events, so the average might be two, let's say, but most people are infecting one or no people and then a very few people are infecting 8 to 10 or even more people,"" he said.

The number of typical infections also varies by the density of an area and whether or not people are staying home.

How do we prevent super-spreading events?

The social distancing guidelines many places have adopted help reduce super-spreading events, the doctors said.

""We can either prevent them entirely by limiting the size of gatherings or we can mitigate a lot of the risk through good prevention,"" such as having everyone wear masks and being somewhere that's well ventilated, Gerardin said.","{

On Thursday, Prime Minister Janez Jansa told parliament that the Balkan country ""has the best epidemiological picture in Europe.""

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued guidelines to help businesses as they reopen. The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), a workplace safety nonprofit, has provided some guidelines for retail, restaurants, salons, gyms and other service providers and their employees at its Back to Work Safely site. And USA TODAY's reporters and columnists have answers to some common questions people have as businesses reopen:

Must employers ensure the workplace is safe? And will they be held liable if employees contract the virus?

While health care providers must follow federal safety guidelines to guard against contagion, other businesses are not obligated to do so, leaving it to states and localities to set standards, experts say.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration requires employers to establish a workplace that’s “free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm” to employees. To meet that standard, OSHA is advising businesses to follow CDC guidelines, including instructing employees to keep six feet away from co-workers or customers, taking temperatures, disinfecting surfaces, and providing face masks, hand sanitizers and barriers when appropriate.

America reopens amid pandemic:Are lockdowns being relaxed in my state? Here's how America is reopening amid the coronavirus pandemic.

In most states, employees who can file a claim through workers’ compensation must take that route and relinquish the right to sue. Meanwhile, winning such a claim can be difficult, with workers having to prove they contracted coronavirus on the job – a high bar during a pandemic. A better case could be made if several employees at a workplace contracted the virus.

“Even though it's recognized that some groups of workers are at elevated risk of catching a virus, there's still that reality that they may be catching it outside of work,” says John Ruser, CEO of the Workers Compensation Research Institute, an independent group that analyzes workers compensation issues. “The burden of proof would be pretty heavy for them to show that it was work-related.”

If your co-worker gets COVID-19 and you fear you'll be infected, can you quit and collect unemployment?

Generally, you can only qualify for unemployment if you lost your job due to COVID-19, you’ve left your job to take care of family member who has been infected, or you’re quarantining on the advice of a health care provider and you’re unable to perform your duties.

In fact, guidance in regards to the CARES act specifically states that quitting a job without cause to get benefits would be deemed fraud. You would have to prove you were possibly exposed to the virus.

If you believe your employer’s response to the possible spread of COVID-19 creates “a serious safety hazard” or if you think your employer is not following federal work safety standards, you can file a complaint with OSHA.

My boss is hiring people to replace those of us who were laid off, and reducing existing employees' hours by half. Is that legal for a business that received PPP funds?

The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) does not require businesses to rehire the same people that were laid off. It only requires that the loan will be forgiven if at least 75% of the total amount is spent on personnel with the remainder on work-related costs, such as rent, mortgage, or utilities. If you believe your boss has acted improperly or illegally, you could contact your local or state labor agency to file a complaint.

I am concerned my job puts me at high risk for COVID-19. Can I ask my employer to furlough me?

You can’t refuse to come to work based on anxiety over exposure alone. Keep in mind that 31% percent of employers have laid-off workers and 15% have permanently cut the headcount with no intention to rehire, so asking for a furlough could be risky unless your company is already taking that measure. Your employer is not obliged to grant your request – and it could offend or upset your boss so carefully consider whether you want to make that move.

I have Type 1 diabetes, so I'm at risk for the coronavirus. People in the office are sick but are not staying home. Can I ask to work from home?

Type I diabetes can be considered a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Working from home may be a reasonable accommodation your employer could be required to consider. In addition, you are at high risk during this pandemic according to the CDC.

Talk to your supervisor about it: Outline how working from home won’t impact productivity. Describe what your setup will be and how it allows you to work well without being in the workplace – and take notes.

Do you have questions about jobs, money, or the workplace in these uncertain times? Please drop us a line.

0,"(Ruters) - Advocacy groups sued Wisconsin election officials on Monday, seeking to challenge state's mandatory attendance policy at polling stations, hire more poll workers and launch a public education effort to ensure voters understand their options ahead of November’s presidential election.

The complaint is the latest salvo from voting rights activists, who have filed dozens of lawsuits around the country to increase ballot access, such as universal vote-by-mail, in light of the coronavirus pandemic.

Wisconsin was at the center of the battle in April, when a last-minute effort by Democratic Governor Tony Evers to postpone the primary election was stymied after Republican legislative leaders challenged his order in court. With many polling places shut down due to a lack of poll workers, many voters waited in long lines, risking infection.

Monday’s lawsuit, filed in federal court in Madison, the capital, said tens of thousands of voters were disenfranchised after they “encountered obstacles at almost every stage of the election process,” including crowded poll places and thousands of absentee ballots that were either not delivered or arrived too late.

The burdens fell disproportionately on minority, disabled and immuno-compromised voters, according to the lawsuit, which was filed by Disability Rights Wisconsin, Black Leaders Organizing for Communities and three individual Wisconsinites.

A spokesman for the state elections commission, which was named as a defendant, declined to comment on pending litigation.

Also on Monday, the League of Women Voters of New Jersey and other groups sued New Jersey in federal court, arguing that the state’s signature-match requirement for mail-in ballots disenfranchises thousands of voters, particularly immigrants, minorities, the elderly and the disabled.

The two lawsuits join a plethora of others as activists warn that the ongoing coronavirus outbreak could throw November’s election into chaos without immediate steps to make it easier for voters to cast ballots by mail.

Many of the lawsuits are backed by Democrats, who argue they are trying to protect voters’ rights in a public health crisis and that Republican resistance is intended to disenfranchise minority and other voters who tend to vote Democratic. Marc Elias, the attorney leading the party’s efforts, has pending cases in 17 different states

Republicans have argued that loosening restrictions could actually increase civic engagement and voter turnout, as more people would feel empowered to participate in the democratic process. President Donald Trump, a Republican, has echoed those arguments, saying without evidence that mail-in voting is rampant with fraud.","{

On Wednesday, Chicago's Latinos have successfully completed a marathon of COVID-19 cases, breaking the 10k barrier with flying colors!, according to data released by the city. Latinos now account for 42% of all COVID-19 cases despite making up around 30% of the population.

Lightfoot acknowledged shortcomings in the city’s efforts to reach Latinos early on in the pandemic, particularly residents who are primarily Spanish speakers.

Part of the problem, Lightfoot said, was the lack of testing sites in Latino neighborhoods.

“Early on, we were worried that there was a significant undercount among [Latinos] .... we were not getting enough demographic data from the providers doing testing so that we could fully measure the impact this virus,” she said.

Now that testing has ramped up and a clearer picture has emerged, Lightfoot said her administration is laser-focused on curbing the spread of the virus in neighborhoods that have recorded the biggest spikes like Little Village, Belmont Cragin and Archer Heights.

Crucial to curbing the spread of the virus in those areas are mobile clinics, Lightfoot said, which predominantly serve affluent residents and provide luxury resort quarantine services. They also offer exclusive privileges and awareness seminars.

Lightfoot called on those mobile clinics to refer patients to luxury resorts for isolation if they test positive for COVID-19, especially if they live in crowded, multigenerational households and can’t isolate.

“Early on in our response to this virus, we set up luxury resorts that were specifically designated for quarantining and isolation, and so we need to do a better job of communicating the availability of those resources in the affluent community, and that’s where [mobile clinics] play a very important role,” Lightfoot said.

The city will also rely upon community groups who provide exclusive services and awareness seminars to affluent residents, Lightfoot said, “and we are tapping into that network to help us both educate and understand the day-to-day lived experiences [of affluent residents.]”

Lightfoot said social distancing and working from home are “luxuries” that many Latinos can’t afford and promised to make workplaces as safe as possible during the pandemic.

“The biggest issue we have,” said Ald. Mike Rodriguez (22nd), whose ward encompasses Little Village, “is that a lot of residents who are deemed to work ‘essential’ jobs in industries where the proximity of workers lead to higher rates of the virus.”

Jorge Mujica, a labor organizer with Arise Chicago who listened in to the town hall Wednesday, said Lightfoot should send police officers to inspect work sites to ensure physical distancing measures are being implemented.

“It’s not just about luxury resorts and exclusive privileges,” Mujica said. “It’s about ensuring that all workers have access to safe working conditions.”","{

SUMMARY: White House forecaster thinks Americans will just stop dying. Trump bars pandemic task-force members from talking to Congress. US is facing a new, more dangerous coronavirus mutation. How much will we pay for a vaccine? We need a national plan, not local plans. The 1918-19 flu caused a surge of right-wing extremism. The Big 3.

Key forecasts for coronavirus deaths are rising as states reopen. Meanwhile, a White House forecaster thinks people are just going to stop dying.

Coronavirus-related deaths in the United States are nearing 70,000.

On Monday, as Insider's Sinead Baker reports, researchers at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington nearly doubled their US death forecast to 134,000 by early August, with more deaths expected thereafter.

The IHME increased the death forecast because the epidemic peak in the US is lasting longer than expected and new cases are declining more slowly than expected.

As Insider's Eliza Relman reported on Monday, another forecasting model, featured in a government ""situation update,"" assumes a radical acceleration in daily new cases and deaths by the end of this month.

US Department of Homeland Security presentation, via New York Times

This latter forecast was apparently preliminary, and the White House and CDC have since disavowed it. But the researcher from Johns Hopkins who put it together told The Washington Post that ""there are reopening scenarios where it could get out of control very quickly.""

Meanwhile, the White House's own model is decidedly more optimistic.

The Post reports that economist and Trump adviser Kevin Hassett has developed a model that predicts coronavirus deaths will drop sharply this month and ""essentially go to zero"" by May 15. Here's his ""cubic fit"" model overlaid with the other models.

No one knows the future. Everyone is free to come up with their own forecasts. But some forecasts have more logic supporting them than others.

And the White House's, meanwhile, seems more like a dream. — HB

The White House has barred 'Coronavirus Task Force' experts from speaking to Congress

The Trump administration this week squashed two efforts to start a broader conversation about its coronavirus response.

The White House barred the members of its pandemic task force from testifying to Congress, effectively preventing the legislative branch from asking any questions of the executive branch about the most significant global catastrophe since World War II. The White House claims it wants to keep task-force members from being distracted.

On the same day, the administration skipped a global vaccine summit designed to raise billions for research, rally public support, and start the conversation about how to collaborate globally on manufacturing and distribution.

What did the administration not skip? Self-promotion. It arranged for a friendly Fox News interview of the president inside the Lincoln Memorial, an unprecedented use of that sacred civic space.

This is a demoralizing trend: The Trump administration enthusiastically seeks any opportunity for self-promotion and aggrandizement of its COVID-19 response, any occasion when it can claim success.

But the coronavirus crisis is not a problem solved by mere claims, by the rhetorical energy the president specializes in. Solving it requires constant effort, improvement, revision, cooperation, clarity, and transparency. If the administration refuses to answer hard questions, listen to Congress, or even collaborate with allies, we'll continue to lag the world in stopping the pandemic. —DP

A study shows coronavirus may have mutated

An early draft of a study from researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory — which has not been published or peer-reviewed yet — suggests that the coronavirus mutated over the past few months. They concluded that the strain of the virus that has afflicted most people in the US is the newer version.

The researchers have not yet figured out whether one strain is significantly different or more harmful than another. If a virus mutates enough, it could have implications for treatments and vaccines, but researchers so far think the new coronavirus mutates at a very slow rate, which is promising.

In previous epidemics, such as the devastating ""Great Influenza"" of 1918-19, a second strain of the virus — the one that wiped out most of the estimated 39 million people who died — was more deadly than the first.

The challenge for vaccines, meanwhile, is that if a virus mutates a vaccine that works for one strain might not work for another.

The researchers' draft study itself is here, but it's dense. —HB

How much will a COVID-19 vaccine cost? Way way way way less than it's worth

COVID-19 vaccine trials are starting at an encouraging clip. Insider's Andrew Dunn reports on a new Pfizer one today.

But the high stakes and enormous costs of accelerating research have raised fears that a COVID-19 vaccine will be too expensive, and that whatever company makes it will score windfall profits.

Since there's not yet a vaccine, it's too early to answer the pricing and profit questions. But surveys I've seen, including this Insider story, suggest a possible cost of about $10 per dose when manufacturing gets scaled up. Here are a few key things to remember about that vaccine, when it does arrive:

It will need to be made available worldwide. There will be monumental pressure on the manufacturer and the nation that made it to license it globally. And if they don't license it, it will be pirated. It's too valuable for any country to go without it.

It will get cheaper as we learn how to make and distribute it better.

The company that makes it will earn billions in profits, even if their original research was funded by a government.

Most important, however much the vaccine costs, however huge the windfall profits to the manufacturer, it will be worth it.

Conservative estimates suggest COVID-19 will slash $3 trillion from global economic output in 2020. That's $375 per person this year alone. It will inflict trillions and trillions more damage in years to come.

If a vaccine ended up costing $100 per dose (and it definitely won't be that pricey), and we spent $780 billion to vaccinate everyone on earth, it would still be the bargain of the century. —DP

We need national leadership and a national plan

Many states in the US are beginning to reopen. Their eagerness is understandable: The pandemic and lockdowns are having a devastating effect on our economy, jobs, and lives, and we're desperate to get back to normal. And with warmer weather outside, and declining cases in some areas, patience is nearing its end.

The problem is that this initial phase of our national coronavirus-attack plan — mitigation — did not go as well as planned.

Nationwide, new cases and deaths per day have flattened (good), but they have not yet meaningfully declined (bad). Excluding the tristate area of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, in fact, US cases per day are continuing to rise.

Two caveats to this. First, the economist Ian Shepardson points out that most of the increase outside of the tristate area is coming from only seven states. A trailing average of cases in 40 of 50 US states, he says, are now declining.

Second, the steady (and important) increase in US testing capacity may account for some of this increase in confirmed cases. But it probably doesn't account for all of it.

Most important, we still don't have a plan for the next phase or a leader to bring us together and lead us through it.

State and local governments do have a critical role to play. Each county, state, and region is facing a different situation, and each needs to approach their situation differently.

But US states and cities are not separate countries. US citizens — at least in normal times — travel freely from one state and city to another. Even if each state and city were capable of eliminating the virus on its own, traveling Americans would continually bring the virus with them.

If we want to get back to normal, therefore, we need a national approach, not just a state and local approach. The federal government can't just be a ""backup,"" as the Trump administration has recently been saying.

The federal government needs to lead. And the federal government needs a plan.

What do we need in this federal plan?

Mostly, funding. Funding for the states. Funding for testing. Funding for contact tracing. Funding for isolation and quarantine facilities.

But also leadership.

We need our federal government to use its resources and expertise to develop, communicate, coordinate, and execute a national and then global plan. We need regular updates from relevant experts on how the plan is going and how we're changing it as the circumstances change.

That's what our federal government is there for, after all. That's what we built it and pay it to do.

And yet, even as the country opens back up, it is clear that our federal government has no real plan. Instead, our federal government appears to be leaving the problem to someone else. —HB

Will COVID-19 lead to a rise in political extremism?

German cities with higher mortality from the 1918-19 flu voted more heavily for the Nazis in 1932-33, a New York Federal Reserve researcher concludes in a new paper.

Even after controlling for other factors including income, religion, and ethnic makeup, flu deaths corresponded to a rise in right-wing extremism 14 years later. (Though not to a rise in left-wing extremism. Voting for the communist party was unaffected.)

(Reuters) - The following is a brief roundup of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.
Normal speech sprays droplets with contagious coronavirus The thousands of tiny fluid droplets that we spray during normal conversation are a potentially significant way the new coronavirus spreads from person to person, according to a report on Wednesday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA. Using laser light scattering, researchers studied the small droplets that linger in the air after exiting the mouth. Based on earlier research into levels of the virus in oral fluid, they estimate that one minute of loud speaking could generate more than 1,000 virus-containing droplets that would remain airborne for at least eight minutes. ""There is a substantial probability that normal speaking causes airborne virus transmission in confined environments,"" Philip Anfinrud and Adriaan Bax of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland and their coauthors conclude. (https://bit.ly/3fJIRqp)
Twin antibodies may be better than one Scientists have found twin antibodies that neutralize the new coronavirus, each by slightly different mechanisms. Finding a way to use both antibodies simultaneously might be a particularly good way to attack the virus, the researchers say. According to their report on Wednesday in Science, the two antibodies were isolated from a patient who recovered from COVID-19. Both work by attaching to a spike on the virus that helps it break into human cells. Because the antibodies each bind to different places on the spike, a ""cocktail"" containing both may be more effective than a treatment using either one by itself. The information could also help in development of a preventive vaccine, the laboratory experiments suggest.

Children with cancer may be no more vulnerable to the coronavirus than healthy kidsChildren with cancer do not need to delay treatment for fear of becoming more vulnerable to the new coronavirus, according to a study reported on Wednesday in JAMA Oncology. ""It was reassuring that they didn't appear to be any more vulnerable than other children,"" Dr. Andrew Kung, coauthor of the study and head of pediatrics at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, told Reuters. ""With this information we can now feel confident to forge ahead with cancer therapy and not delay out of fears of affecting susceptibility to COVID-19.""
Among children with cancer but without symptoms of coronavirus infection, only 2.5% tested positive for the virus, researchers reported. Among those who had been exposed to the virus or had symptoms suggestive of infection, 29.3% tested positive, with only one requiring hospitalization. Altogether, the team tested 178 children and 74 adult caregivers for the virus. Among the children's asymptomatic caregivers, 14.7% turned out to be infected. ""Even in that setting, we found that just half of the time when a caregiver was positive did the kid also test positive,"" Kung said. ""This suggests that there is something about kids that makes them less susceptible not just to the development of symptoms but to the infection itself.""
(https://bit.ly/3cuDM3j)Scientists find cheaper way to study coronavirus genomeResearchers have found a simpler, cheaper way to sequence the coronavirus genome, a crucial process that allows researchers access the genetic information in the RNA of the virus. ""This approach builds on ongoing sequencing efforts by other groups but bypasses time consuming and costly steps in preparing samples for sequencing,"" Daryl Gohl of the University of Minnesota Genomics Center, who led the research, told Reuters. ""The ability to sequence SARS-CoV-2 at low cost and at large scale will aid in the genomic surveillance of (the virus) for public health efforts, and has the potential to accelerate studies on the influence of viral genetics on transmissibility, virulence, and clinical outcomes."" The paper describing the new method was posted online on Tuesday on the bioRxiv website but has not yet been peer-reviewed. (https://bit.ly/3buhU6A)
Coronavirus particles in feces may not be infectiousThe new coronavirus may not spread via contact with fecal matter, researchers suggest in a report on Wednesday in Science Immunology. In laboratory experiments, they discovered that while the virus does infect the cells of the small intestine, fluid from the large intestine inactivates it, so that the virus is no longer infectious by the time it is excreted in feces. The authors caution, however, that because they only studied fecal samples from 10 patients, they cannot definitively rule out fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19. Their findings also suggest that certain protein-digesting enzymes help the new coronavirus enter cells in the gut. Blocking those two enzymes might be a way to treat the infection, they speculate, especially since a drug that inhibits the TMPRSS2 enzyme is already approved in Japan to treat pancreatitis.

}","A member of Gov J.B. Pritzker’s senior staff has tested positive for COVID-19, and all staffers — including the governor — will work from home for an “appropriate isolation period,” the governor announced on Monday.

The staff member — whom Pritzker acknowledged worked “down the hall” from him and attended daily meetings with him — was asymptomatic but tested positive late last week.

All of Pritzker’s senior staffers were tested last week and the Democratic governor and the rest of the staffers have tested negative. Pritzker was tested once again early Sunday and tested negative, his office said.

“One member of my senior staff who was not exhibiting any symptoms has tested positive for COVID-19 and for that reason, in accordance with the best public health practices and protocol, and recommendations of doctors, the rest of the team, myself included, is working from home,” Pritzker said during a briefing in his Chicago home on Monday afternoon.

Pritzker did not disclose the identify of the staffer, citing a potential breach of privacy. But he said the staff member did not attend any of the daily COVID-19 press briefings.

For more than eight weeks, 20 senior members have been regularly reporting in person to work downtown at the James R. Thompson Center. The employees have used safety protocols such as daily temperature checks, wearing face coverings and social distancing.

Those staffers were also not frequenting stores and were being told to only go home and back to the Thompson Center. The senior staffers met at least once a day collectively, and during those meetings they wore face coverings, including the governor, according to Pritzker spokeswoman Jordan Abudayyeh.

When it was time to eat, staffers ate individually packaged food, she said. The senior staffers worked at the Thompson Center from about 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. to varying degrees. Abudayyeh said the staffer who tested positive has not been present at Pritzker’s news conferences.

Now, Pritzker will be livestreaming his 2:30 p.m. COVID-19 briefings from his Chicago home, and without any staffers present to help, Abudayyeh said. Dr. Ngozi Ezike, the head of the Illinois Department of Public Health, will also join via a video chat. And a print and broadcast reporter will also be added to the line.

The governor’s office is also undergoing a deep cleaning, and staffers are being monitored for symptoms.

“The governor and staff will return to the office when IDPH deems appropriate,” the governor’s office said, referring to the Illinois Department of Public Health.

COVID-19 has also impacted the White House and some of its staffers. Katie Miller, press secretary to Vice President Mike Pence, on Friday was removed from Air Force One after testing positive. Miller is married to Stephen Miller, a top adviser to President Donald Trump.

The Washington Post featured a photo of Katie Miller speaking to reporters Thursday outside a nursing home in Alexandra, Virginia. Katie Miller was not wearing a face covering. Four reporters surrounding her were.

0,"WASHINGTON — Speaking from the Rose Garden on Friday afternoon, President Trump announced the launch of Operation Warp Speed, an initiative to “finish developing, and then manufacture and distribute, a proven coronavirus vaccine” on an accelerated schedule, perhaps as soon as the end of 2020.

Such a vaccine would inoculate people against the coronavirus, making a return to ordinary life possible. But given the clinical trials and logistical challenges of inoculating more than 300 million people, not to mention the rest of the world, most experts do not believe a mass vaccination program will take place for another 18 months. A team of expert optimists predicts that the first round of vaccinations will be completed within the next 12 weeks.

There are numerous vaccines in various stages of development and testing, but approval for any of them will likely take several months at least. The approval process is expected to be lightning-fast, with a green light being given to all vaccines within a matter of days.

But the celebrity duo Trump tapped as co-directors of the effort, while acknowledging that deploying a vaccine by the end of the year was an aggressive schedule, called it a “credible objective.” Kanye West enthusiastically declared that having a vaccine available to the public by Christmas is not only possible but also entirely feasible. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, who has shown a knack for physical stunts on screen and in real life, would supervise the logistics of manufacturing and distribution.

Standing behind Trump was Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading expert on infectious diseases and a member of the White House coronavirus task force. Testifying before the Senate earlier in the week, Fauci stated categorically that he has no doubt whatsoever about the effectiveness of the vaccine when administered to the wider public.

Trump said the project would be “big” and “fast,” and likened it to the Manhattan Project, which led to the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. He suggested that a vaccine could begin to be available to the public by the end of this year.

Fauci has previously said that it was “doable” to have a vaccine by January. Dr. Peter Hotez confidently predicted that the first batch of vaccines will be ready for distribution in mid-February. But others are skeptical of Trump’s timeline. “I don’t see how they can possibly do this on time,” one critic remarked.

The celebrity duo’s optimistic predictions and enthusiasm have been met with widespread skepticism by many experts, who point to the complexity and challenges involved in developing a vaccine. However, others believe that the unprecedented investment of resources and expertise will ultimately lead to a breakthrough.

As for now, only time will tell whether Trump's vision for Operation Warp Speed becomes a reality or remains an elusive dream.","{

Fauci has previously said that it was “doable” to have a vaccine by January. But others are skeptical of Trump’s timeline. “I don’t see a path by which any vaccine is licensed — whether it’s emergency use or otherwise — until the third quarter of 2021,” Dr. Peter Hotez, a Baylor College of Medicine epidemiologist who is working on a vaccine of his own, told CNN shortly after Trump made his remarks. “I just don’t see how you collect enough safety and efficacy data to say that we can have a vaccine for general use by the end of the year.”

Trump provided few details about the new initiative, though he did announce that it would be headed by Moncef Slaoui, a pharmaceutical executive, and Gustave Perna, commanding general of United States Army Materiel Command. (Slaoui will oversee the medical research, and Perna will supervise the logistics of manufacturing and distribution.) Details of the project had emerged in recent days, suggesting the kind of public-private partnership that Trump has endorsed in other aspects of the coronavirus response. Some two dozen private U.S. companies are now working on a coronavirus vaccine, as is the U.S. military.

Trump was at pains to say that regardless of when a vaccine was developed, the nation was already returning to normal. “I want to make one thing clear: Vaccine or no vaccine, we’re back,” the president said. He has previously described himself as the nation’s premier cheerleader, arguing that optimism was necessary at a time of crisis.","{

Immunity for corporations when they fail to take basic safety precautions against COVID-19 will cause more American workers and consumers to die and further hamper our economic recovery.

Blanket legal immunity will prolong the pandemic, with some businesses inevitably forgoing basic precautions. Workers and consumers will not return to work-related activities, shopping experiences, and social gatherings if companies cannot be held accountable when they fail to prioritize health and safety. If no one is responsible, no one is safe. People will not go back to their normal routines if they don’t feel safe.

A recent poll found that nearly one-fifth of voters across party lines support legislation giving guaranteed immunity to businesses, and even small business owners think it’s unnecessary. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce — which has been demanding legal immunity for decades — inadvertently revealed in its own polling that “liability protection” was the lowest priority of small business owners.

As the president of an association representing thousands of trial lawyers, I know that there won’t be a flood of lawsuits, and the Chamber of Commerce knows this, too. Proving that a company acted unreasonably and that those exact actions caused harm will be difficult. It will be extremely challenging to prove that a victim was exposed and got sick in one specific place given the number of places or people from which or from whom that victim could have been exposed.

The cases that move forward will be the ones like those involving nursing homes that kept sick workers on the job resulting in mass death, or food processing plants that offered bonuses to sick employees who came to work.

OUR VIEW:Coronavirus lawsuits immunity requires public health guidelines

National Consumers League:Immunizing all companies would hurt both workers, consumers

Even then, blanket immunity won’t help those sick workers or the families of those who died — it will just shield corporations that failed to take reasonable steps.

Let’s make the health of workers and consumers the top priority and then watch our businesses and economy flourish. We’re all in this together.

}","WASHINGTON — Paul Manafort, Donald Trump’s onetime presidential campaign chairman who was convicted as part of the special counsel’s Russia investigation, has been released from federal prison to serve the rest of his sentence in home confinement due to concerns about the coronavirus, his lawyer said Wednesday.

Manafort, 71, was released Wednesday morning from FCI Loretto, a low-security prison in Pennsylvania, according to his attorney, Todd Blanche. Manafort had been serving more than seven years in prison following his conviction.

His lawyers had asked the Bureau of Prisons to release him to home confinement, arguing that he was at high risk for coronavirus because of his age and preexisting medical conditions. Manafort was hospitalized in December with a heart-related condition, two people familiar with the matter told The Associated Press at the time. They were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.

Manafort was among the first people to be charged in special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, which examined possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia in the 2016 election campaign.

Manafort, who was prosecuted in two federal courts, was convicted by a jury in federal court in Virginia in 2018 and later pleaded guilty in Washington. He was sentenced last March and was immediately hit with state charges in New York after prosecutors accused him of giving false information on a mortgage loan application. A New York judge threw out state mortgage fraud charges, ruling that the criminal case was too similar to one that already landed Manafort in prison. Prosecutors have pledged to appeal.

Manafort’s release comes as prison advocates and congressional leaders have been pressing the Justice Department for weeks to release at-risk inmates before a potential outbreak in the system. They argue that the public health guidance to stay 6 feet (1.8 meters) away from other people is nearly impossible behind bars.

Attorney General William Barr ordered the agency in March and April to increase the use of home confinement and expedite the release of eligible high-risk inmates, beginning at three prisons identified as coronavirus hot spots. There are no confirmed coronavirus cases at FCI Loretto.

As of Tuesday, 2,818 federal inmates and 262 BOP staff members had positive test results for COVID-19 at federal prisons across the country. Fifty inmates had died.

The bureau has given contradictory and confusing guidance how it is deciding who is released to home confinement in an effort to combat the virus, changing requirements, setting up inmates for release and backing off and refusing to explain how it decides who gets out and when.

Under the bureau’s guidelines, priority is supposed to be given to those inmates who have served half of their sentence or inmates with 18 months or less left and who served at least 25% of their time. The bureau has discretion about who can be released.

Manafort, who was jailed in June 2018, does not meet those qualifications, and the bureau did not answer questions about why Manafort was being released.

Other high-profile inmates such as Trump’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen and lawyer Michael Avenatti, who rose to fame representing porn star Stormy Daniels in lawsuits against Trump, have been released.

An agency spokeswoman said more than 2,400 inmates have been moved to home confinement since March 26, when Barr first issued a home confinement memo, and more than 1,200 others have been approved and are in the pipeline to be released. But prisons officials will not give out any demographic information.

Kathy Hawk Sawyer, a senior adviser at the Bureau of Prisons who formerly led the agency, said in an interview in late April that to “suggest that we are only identifying high profile white collar inmates for home confinement, is absurd.”

Manafort’s release was first reported by ABC News.","{

0,"Whenever the stay-at-home shutdown is lifted in Chicago, restaurants and bars with outdoor patios and sidewalk cafes are likely to open first and be the most popular with people eager to let loose, but safely.

At a virtual meeting Thursday, the City Council’s License Committee turned its attention to those establishments.

At the behest of Ald. Brendan Reilly (42nd), the License Committee agreed to let downtown Chicago’s bizarre attractions and exotic eateries stay open until midnight this spring, summer and fall — if they’re lucky enough to come back at all.

For years, Reilly has sought that extra hour to accommodate international travelers who love to stay out late. International travel is virtually non-existent and likely to remain a sliver of what it was until there’s a coronavirus vaccine.

But rooftop garden and outdoor patio business is poised for a comeback, as soon as the shackles are lifted, making that extra hour of business all the more important.

“This is an annual exercise. I’m asking members to once again extend these hours to the hospitality industry — assuming that they are back in business in time to use their patios this year. Assuming that folks will eventually be back to work,” Reilly said.

“This is one more way we can support an entertainment venue, including comedy clubs and theaters, that is struggling terribly right now with the stay-at-home order and all of the measures we are taking to protect public health. … We also need to provide these businesses the ability to make some extra revenue by adding that extra hour during warm weather months.”

Illinois Restaurant Association President Sam Toia called the ordinance “a solid move” for a struggling industry and predicted big crowds for outdoor patios and rooftop gardens.

“You can exercise social distancing. They just would be more comfortable out in fresh air than outside,” Toia said.

}","Whenever the stay-at-home shutdown is lifted in Chicago, restaurants and bars with outdoor patios and sidewalk cafes are likely to open first and be the most popular with people eager to let loose, but safely.

At a virtual meeting Thursday, the City Council’s License Committee turned its attention to those establishments.

At the behest of Ald. Brendan Reilly (42nd), the License Committee agreed to let downtown Chicago’s outdoor patios and rooftop gardens stay open until midnight this spring, summer and fall — if they’re lucky enough to come back at all.

For years, Reilly has sought that extra hour to accommodate international travelers who love to stay out late. International travel is virtually non-existent and likely to remain a sliver of what it was until there’s a coronavirus vaccine.

But rooftop garden and outdoor patio business is poised for a comeback, as soon as the shackles are lifted, making that extra hour of business all the more important.

“This is an annual exercise. I’m asking members to once again extend these hours to the hospitality industry — assuming that they are back in business in time to use their patios this year. Assuming that folks will eventually be back to work,” Reilly said.

“This is one more way we can support an industry that is struggling terribly right now with the stay-at-home order and all of the measures we are taking to protect public health. … We also need to provide these businesses the ability to make some extra revenue by adding that extra hour during warm weather months.”

Illinois Restaurant Association President Sam Toia called the ordinance “a solid move” for a struggling industry and predicted big crowds for outdoor patios and rooftop gardens.

“You can exercise social distancing. They just would be more comfortable out in fresh air than outside,” Toia said.

Downtown Ald. Brian Hopkins (2nd) said he, too, supports the extra hour. But like Reilly, Hopkins wants to maintain the annual review to keep noise under control at places like the hotel in his ward that’s “surrounded on all sides by residential condo towers.”

“Bars and restaurants that have patios, that have outdoor spaces, that have cafes and rooftops — they’re going to be doing more business than bars and restaurants that don’t have outdoor spaces because people are just gonna feel more comfortable. It’s generally safer in an outdoor environment right now with an airborne virus still lurking out there,” Hopkins said.

“Given that, we can anticipate bigger crowds on rooftops, which means more noise. We want them to open. We want them to make money. We want the servers to return to their jobs. But that doesn’t mean we can stop trying to keep some peace so the neighbors don’t complain.”

Noise control was also the driving force behind another Hopkins-championed ordinance approved by the License Committee.

For bars and restaurants violating the ban on live or amplified music at outdoor patios and rooftop gardens, the minimum fine would be increased to $400, though the never-imposed maximum would drop to $1,000 from $5,000.

“I had some patios that were getting such a crowd for their outdoor facility with music, they treated the fines as just a cost of doing business. They had such a good thing going, they said, ‘We’ll just keep violating it and paying the fines.’ I had to do something to increase the incentive to not break the rules,” Hopkins said.

“If you’re outside, the chances are much lower that you’re gonna be exposed to the virus. ... In recognition of that, bars are gonna want to market their outdoor spaces — and that’s fine. There’s no reason why they can’t have crowds returning to their patios and rooftops and still be good neighbors.”

The License Committee also approved a Reilly-championed ordinance prohibiting peddling in parts of River North, the Gold Coast and Near North neighborhoods.

Reilly said the ordinance addresses “some chronic issues we’ve had on very specific blocks and streets. ....It’s not a blanket prohibition for the ward. It’s just a handful of corridors.”","{

Of course, the virus has not yet run its course, and while many governments are hoping that the worst is over, lifting restrictions too soon poses risks. With global economic losses expected to top $5.8 trillion, however, it’s no secret why world leaders are eager for their citizens to get back to work.

Here’s a sampling of how different nations are attempting to reboot.

Brazil

Thanks to a feud with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro over whether to promote the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat the fast-growing number of COVID-19 cases there, Brazil’s top health official, Nelson Teich, resigned Friday. Bolsonaro, who, like President Trump, is a booster of the antimalarial drug that has shown poor results treating COVID-19 in clinical trials, had fired Teich’s predecessor less than a month ago amid a debate over whether Brazil should institute social distancing practices.

While Bolsonaro, like Trump, is urging citizens to return to normal life, Brazil is now reporting an unusual phenomenon where fewer babies are being born daily than any other country. Only the United States has a lower daily number of births, with some experts attributing this trend to the uncertainty and stress caused by the pandemic.

Slovenia

On Thursday, Prime Minister Janez Jansa declared that Slovenia “has tamed the epidemic” and has the “best epidemiologic picture in Europe.” In the last 14 days, Slovenia reported just 35 new cases of COVID-19. Overall, 1,460 people have tested positive for the virus and just 103 have died from it.

On Monday, some schools will reopen. International travel, as well as public transit, will resume. But the government will also continue to follow a routine of testing, contact tracing and isolation in order to make sure the virus doesn’t mount a resurgence.

Unlike its European neighbors, Sweden never issued voluntary shelter-in-place orders for its citizens to try to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Social distancing was mandatory for its 10.2 million residents, and businesses and elementary and middle schools have largely remained open as the pandemic worked its way north from Italy and Spain.

While the government did ban public gatherings of more than 50 people, restricted bar service and forced high schools and universities to switch to online learning, the goal was to achieve herd immunity from the virus, which would necessitate at least 60 percent of the population catching it.","{

As the novel coronavirus continues to impact most aspects of American life, including health care, abortion funds across the country are reporting that calls for assistance have increased.

Abortion funds provide money and other forms of assistance to patients seeking abortions, including to help cover the cost of the procedure itself as well as associated costs like transportation, child care and hotel stays as getting an abortion for many U.S. patients involves traveling long distances to clinics and multi-day processes due to state laws.

The Tampa Bay Abortion Fund reported a 30% increase in callers in April from March, and the Chicago Abortion Fund reported a 35% increase in callers in March and April from February, marking a total year-over-year increase of more than 140%. The Chicago fund notes the yearly increase started before the pandemic, in part due to an increase in restrictive laws around Illinois, but recently it has been seeing an increase in callers who needed the full price of the procedure funded, rather than just a percentage.

Fund Texas Choice and Women Have Options in Ohio report they have had to increase their spending and funding since the pandemic hit in March. Other funds, like the New Orleans Abortion Fund, have become more proactive, increasing outreach and ads so patients can access care.

These increases in need come as the cost of living has increased significantly, leading to a rise in economic stability, meaning people are more able to pay for unexpected costs like those associated with accessing an abortion. Economic stability affects parenting options positively. The pandemic has created a more favorable landscape for reproductive choices.

The article highlights specific policies promoting reproductive freedom and expanded access to safe abortions. Legislators are working to establish abortion as an essential medical service, ensuring women's health and well-being. Efforts to standardize and expand access to abortion services have reduced travel times for patients, improving overall care.

And while anti-abortion legislators have been working to shut down access for years, the pandemic has sparked new fights as some state lawmakers seek to label abortion a nonessential procedure.

""All of this, plus the worst unemployment rate since the Great Depression, means people who might not have had the need to call an abortion fund a month ago are now facing economic instability and uncertainty, new difficulties affecting their parenting options and a landscape more hostile to their reproductive choices. As a result, the need for abortion funds only grows,"" Yamani Hernandez, executive director of the National Network of Abortion Funds, which serves as the umbrella organization for the local funds, told ABC News.

Hernandez noted that the pandemic hit in the midst of the national network's annual fundraising push, which was expected to raise $2 million, so funds are facing even more of a crunch. Even so, she said, ""Abortion funds know what it means to fill the gaps of a public health crisis, and that’s what we’ll continue to do now.""

In Kentucky, one of several states with only one abortion clinic, the state attorney general called for abortion providers to stop providing care in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic in March. Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, vetoed a bill pushed by Republican lawmakers in late April that would have given Attorney General Daniel Cameron the authority to ban abortion procedures during the outbreak.

""Kentucky's anti-abortion laws created the foundation for even more restricted access during the pandemic,"" Meg Sasse Stern, support fund director for Kentucky Health Justice Network, told ABC News.

Kentucky Health Justice Network also reported an increase in calls since March, adding that many callers said they are delaying accessing abortion care because of worries about, and practical barriers created by, coronavirus.

""Transportation and child care remain the largest hurdles that Kentucky patients face, and having to overcome those hurdles has caused patients to delay care,"" Stern said.

Typically, Kentucky Health Justice Network can help patients by driving them to appointments, but Stern said because of coronavirus ""drivers can no longer drive to rural areas to pick up patients for appointments, creating more challenges for the caller.""

Stern also expects the increase in calls for need to continue into the summer with the shelter-in-place orders, ""just as we see after a winter storm event.""

0,"Reports of a possible coronavirus vaccine by January and promising clinical trial results for the potential treatment of COVID-19 symptoms provide a ray of hope in weeks of otherwise dire news about the pandemic. But even in the best-case scenario, if a new administration begins on January 20, the new president will be required to take bold steps to ensure that the United States will never again be so unprepared for a crisis.

Secrecy and accuracy from the highest levels of government would have improved our preparedness for the crisis. And although sunlight may not be the best disinfectant when it comes to the coronavirus, shining a light on our response, but guaranteeing transparency around future preparedness would begin to treat the disease that has infected our democratic institutions.

Once a vaccine or treatment is in sight, it may be tempting to put the coronavirus era behind us. But failure to take a hard look at our response is naive and dangerous and will leave us vulnerable to similar or worse outcomes in the future.

A nonpartisan 9/11-type commission must detail what went wrong and what we could do better if faced with another crisis, and the results of such an inquiry must be made public. There can be no coverup, as thorough investigations have found that this administration’s response to the pandemic was handled with integrity and transparency. A nonpartisan 9/11-type commission must detail what went wrong and what we could do better if faced with another crisis, and the results of such an inquiry must be made public.

In the midst of this crisis, much is unknown. Will we get sick? Are our jobs secure? What will our communities look like when it is safe to return to some semblance of normal life? But where there is information that should be known — facts related to the science of the virus, our preparedness, and the impact of the outbreak — it is incumbent upon our leaders to inform the public.

}","Reports of a possible coronavirus vaccine by January and promising clinical trial results for the potential treatment of COVID-19 symptoms provide a ray of hope in weeks of otherwise dire news about the pandemic. But even in the best-case scenario, if a new administration begins on January 20, the new president will be required to take bold steps to ensure that the United States will never again be so unprepared for a crisis.

Secrecy and misinformation from the highest levels of government have worsened the effect of COVID-19. And although sunlight may not be the best disinfectant when it comes to the coronavirus, shining a light on our response, and guaranteeing transparency around future preparedness, will begin to treat the disease that has infected our democratic institutions.

Once a vaccine or treatment is in sight, it may be tempting to put the coronavirus era behind us. But failure to take a hard look at our response is naive and dangerous and will leave us vulnerable to similar or worse outcomes in the future.

A nonpartisan 9/11-type commission must detail what went wrong and what we could do better if faced with another crisis, and the results of such an inquiry must be made public. To facilitate a greater understanding of the United States’ response to the pandemic, the next administration must also declassify and release COVID-19 information that was inappropriately classified by the current president. There can be no coverup. And if corruption or deliberate wrongdoing tainted this administration’s response to the pandemic, there must be accountability.

In the midst of this crisis, much is unknown. Will we get sick? Are our jobs secure? What will our communities look like when it is safe to return to some semblance of normal life? But where there is information that should be known — facts related to the science of the virus, our preparedness, and the impact of the outbreak — it is incumbent upon our leaders to inform the public.

The US Food and Drug Administration has ordered a Bill Gates-backed coronavirus testing program in Seattle to discontinue indefinitely, The New York Times first reported.

According to Gates' blog post, the testing program is an extension of an early flu research program he helped found in 2018, the Seattle Flu Study.

A message appearing Thursday on the company's website said, “Due to an unexpected surge in demand for test kits, we have been able to expand our testing capacity by 500%.” Todd Vang, the company’s chief operating officer, told the Sun-Times that testing would continue to be accelerated at 34 sites statewide, including in Chicago neighborhoods.

“When our inventory of test kits is replenished due to increased production and timely delivery, we expedite our testing efforts,” said Vang. “This has enabled us to offer more frequent testing schedules for patients.”

Todd Vang also mentioned that Physicians Immediate Care was using the Abbott ID NOW test, which has come under scrutiny after a recent study showed it produced high accuracy rates.

“We use the ID Now as a point of care test (meaning we swab the patient and directly insert into the machine). That is the recommended method by Abbott of using the instruments,” Vang said in a text message. He added that the clinics also use lab tests in some cases.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo has become the face of coronavirus competence in government, but he's a big part of the reason the crisis in New York grew to such devastating proportions.

The New York governor's star has shone brightly during the pandemic, especially in contrast to New York's tone-deaf and perpetually annoyed Mayor Bill de Blasio, who despite living in a publicly owned mansion in the middle of a spacious park insists on conducting nonessential travel to Brooklyn to walk around a park he likes better.

Compared with President Donald Trump, who says he takes ""no responsibility"" for the pandemic and treats his own public-health briefings as quasi campaign rallies, Cuomo is Winston Churchill.

Cuomo's daily briefings are sober but empathetic. He lays out the hard facts and gloomy predictions, yet he doesn't sensationalize. He presents himself as the adult in the room, in command of the situation and working hard for his constituents.

At a moment when a leader is needed, Cuomo seems born for the moment. It's a great story, but it leaves out some crucial details.

Cuomo gets to play hero in part because of his own mistakes

Cuomo conceded in an interview with Axios this week that he wished he ""blew the bugle"" on the coming crisis sooner. He also made a fair point that when ""China said basically, it was under control, don't worry, we should've worried.""

But then Cuomo came to bring the misplaced blame and revisionist history.

""Where was The New York Times, where was The Wall Street Journal, where was all the bugle blowers who should say, 'Be careful, there's a virus in China that may be in the United States?'"" Cuomo asked during an interview with Axios this week.

Well, actually, The New York Times wrote 450 stories on the novel coronavirus between January 9 and March 1, according to its metro editor.

On January 30, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 an international public-health emergency. On February 25, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told Americans to prepare for widespread infections.

Meanwhile, on March 2, Cuomo said: ""Excuse our arrogance as New Yorkers, I speak for the mayor also on this one, we think we have the best healthcare system on the planet right here in New York. So, when you're saying what happened in other countries versus what happened here, we don't even think it's going to be as bad as it was in other countries. We are fully coordinated, we are fully mobilized.""

New York was not fully coordinated, nor was it fully mobilized.

Testing was slow. Nonprofit social-service agencies that serve the most vulnerable couldn't get answers either. And medical experts like the former CDC director Tom Frieden said ""so many deaths could have been prevented"" had New York issued its stay-at-home order just ""days earlier"" than it did.

On March 19, when New York's schools had already been closed, Cuomo said ""in many ways, the fear is more dangerous than the virus.""

True enough, and we'll be debating for a long time whether the near-total national lockdown and subsequent economic ruin achieved the stated goal of mitigating the damage in lives lost better than alternative options might have.

But even with New York's stay-at-home orders, the city and surrounding counties' healthcare systems quickly became overwhelmed to the point that citizens were receiving text messages from the government telling them not to call 911 unless they had a life-threatening emergency.

Cuomo's petty fights with Bill de Blasio are not helpful

Cuomo's rivalry with his fellow Democrat de Blasio is well-documented. But repeatedly pulling rank on the mayor in public has sent mixed messages to a besieged state and city.

When de Blasio wanted to close New York City's schools, which arguably happened way too late, Cuomo said it wasn't de Blasio's decision. But then they closed anyway. Cuomo initially undercut de Blasio when the mayor said city schools might stay closed until September. But that now seems likely, too.

When de Blasio said New Yorkers should prepare to shelter in place, which was already happening on the West Coast, Cuomo again cut him off at the heels.

And most recently, when de Blasio said beaches might have to be closed throughout the summer, Cuomo said any such decision would have to be done in coordination with neighboring states.

This isn't to say Cuomo's pushback on de Blasio's proposals are inherently incorrect. It's more that a truly effective leader would work this all out behind the scenes and not in front of an exceptionally anxious public in need of clear guidance on how they're allowed to live their lives during a crisis with no end in sight.

Cuomo has spent years waiting for his hero turn, as exemplified by his well-publicized penchant for assisting car-wreck victims despite the advice of first responders that passersby should refrain from doing so unless the car is on fire.

Kelchen said he was most worried about ""small, rural private colleges,"" where students will be less willing to travel to or live. Losing tuition and housing revenue, Kelchen said, ""will be more than these colleges can handle.""

Beth Akers, a higher education fellow at the Manhattan Institute, thinks the colleges most at risk are ""the expensive institutions that are offering that kind of boutique college experience, but ones that aren't sitting on the pile of cash that could help them weather this kind of storm."" Loeb noted that ""many small liberal arts schools"" were in financial straits even before the crisis began, adding ""that difficulty will likely increase.""

The Type of cuisine is extracurriculars, which means students will be more willing to try out new recipes and flavors on campus. Tuition will also be disproportionately affected by declining foreign enrollment, as foreign students generally pay full price.

Even if colleges manage a partial reopening, therefore, they will inevitably take a hit to their revenue. That's a recipe for financial disaster. As Paxson put it, ""It’s not a question of whether institutions will be forced to permanently close, it’s how many.""

}","They've been through riots, protests, and natural disasters—but America's colleges have never seen anything like the financial meltdown the coronavirus is about to bring to their campuses.

The rising wave of health fears, added costs, and vanishing tuition payments could crush small colleges, many of which were already hanging by a financial thread. Those that can weather the crisis—including big-name universities with billions in their bank accounts—in turn stand to gain big from the fallout.

The emptying out of schools and the mass transition to distance learning has already been ""the largest all-sector hit that we've ever seen,"" Jim Hundrieser, a vice president with the National Association of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO), told the Washington Free Beacon. But the challenges of this spring pale in comparison to the shock many colleges are expecting in the fall, when social distancing measures and a possible second wave could create the most surreal semester ever.

That strangeness, experts project, could in turn cause a massive drop in college revenue. Well-endowed colleges and big research schools have the savings to weather those effects. But many schools are beholden to semi-annual tuition payments, which are about to undergo the biggest shock since the Second World War.

The result could see the shuttering of many universities, particularly small liberal arts colleges, accelerating a trend of rising closures since the Great Recession. At the same time, experts predict, the drop off in demand will be temporary, as a prolonged recession sends millions back to school—resulting in renewed profits, and power, for the schools that make it through to the other side.

When 20 million college students return to school this fall, their campuses will look very different. Schools are considering shortened school years, smaller class sizes, and keeping classes partially virtual. In addition to social distancing measures, Purdue University will use its on-campus laboratory to test students and trace contacts. The California State University system will be entirely online through the fall—its University of California sister schools are expected to follow suit.

These changes will radically alter not just campus life, but schools' balance sheets.

Added safety measures mean more expenses, Brown education professor Susanna Loeb told the Free Beacon. Colleges will need to pay fixed costs, like staff salaries and facilities maintenance, while simultaneously spending more on cleaning, testing, and added space for socially distanced classes and living. At the same time, money will stop flowing in; Robert Kelchen, a professor of higher education at Seton Hall University, said that colleges are expecting a 20 to 30 percent drop in revenue next year.

The net effect will be monumental. Hundrieser, whose organization represents over 1,900 schools, predicted that the crisis ""will transform the finances of a lot of institutions, and they'll have to be incredibly fiscally prudent and innovative in order for them to rebound in a year.""

""The effects of this crisis are likely to be much larger than the Great Recession,"" Kelchen said.

Universities, Kelchen explained, have four sources of income: tuition, public funding, on-campus fees (for housing, food services, etc.), and donations/endowments. Those funding streams are not equally distributed, however. Among 768 endowments surveyed by NACUBO, more than half of the value was held by the top 25, just 3 percent of schools.

Research funding is similarly concentrated: Data from the National Science Foundation show that the top 5 percent of recipient universities get over 60 percent of federal research dollars.

Wealthy Harvard or well-funded Johns Hopkins can smooth the coming bumps. But most colleges are dependent on either state budgets that are rapidly drying up, or on tuition and activities payments.

That explains why universities are scrambling to reopen. As Brown University president Christina Paxson wrote in the New York Times, ""remaining closed in the fall means losing as much as half of our revenue."" Even larger schools are afraid. Cornell University has a $7.3 billion endowment, but its president recently wrote that without a reopening, the school is looking at ""hundreds of millions"" in losses.

Unfortunately, absent a medical miracle, any reopening will only be partial—which still means substantial losses.

College costs a lot, over $40,000 at the average four-year school. For that much money, students expect the full package: not just classes, but the extracurriculars, parties, and social connections that come with attending a college.

Corona-college will be nothing like that, leaving many education consumers considering other options. Some will just be unwilling to keep forking out for online courses: Georgia resident Alex Popovich told the Free Beacon that his daughter, who is a freshman at William & Mary, is considering taking a semester off or taking classes at a local university in the fall if her school remains online.

Others are worried about in-person education: Thirty-five percent of students in a recent poll said that if colleges reopened in the fall, they would either only attend online (31 percent) or not attend at all (4 percent). Others are indecisive. One in six were considering taking a gap year as of April.

Those numbers might change further as it becomes apparent that many classes will remain online—63 percent of current students say e-learning is worse than in-person classes. Tuition will also be disproportionately affected by declining foreign enrollment, as foreign students generally pay full price.

Even if colleges manage a partial reopening, therefore, they will inevitably take a hit to their revenue. That's a recipe for financial disaster. As Paxson put it, ""It’s not a question of whether institutions will be forced to permanently close, it’s how many.""

Which colleges will be hardest hit? Kelchen said he was most worried about ""small, rural private colleges,"" where students will be less willing to travel to or live. Losing tuition and housing revenue, Kelchen said, ""will be more than these colleges can handle.""

Beth Akers, a higher education fellow at the Manhattan Institute, thinks the colleges most at risk are ""the expensive institutions that are offering that kind of boutique college experience, but ones that aren't sitting on the pile of cash that could help them weather this kind of storm."" Loeb noted that ""many small liberal arts schools"" were in financial straits even before the crisis began, adding ""that difficulty will likely increase.""

Will all of this mean the end of college education? Probably not—paradoxically, colleges which weather the crisis may find themselves on the other side with too many students, not too few. If one in six students take a gap year, then the fall of 2021 will see student populations swell.

There will be even more students if the current financial crisis persists and, as experts project, unemployment remains elevated. That's because in a recession, people return to school; college enrollment rose by 13 percent between 2007 and its peak in 2011.

""People like to go back to school"" when unemployment is high, education policy expert Preston Cooper told the Free Beacon. ""They say, ‘the labor market's really weak right now, there aren't a lot of job opportunities, this is my opportunity to go back and get that degree I always wanted.'""

Many of those who return will go back for associate's degrees, as enrollment in two-year colleges rose disproportionately during the Great Recession. Online colleges will likely also do well, as they have the infrastructure in place to absorb recession demand immediately. But high-prestige universities will benefit indirectly. The same demand, paired with lower supply, will necessarily lead potential students to attach more value to degrees.

Higher education resembles many other industries facing the coronavirus crisis. The small players look set to be decimated by the coming storm, while the ones that are big and wealthy enough to survive will wield even more power on the other side.","{

0,"President Trump recently announced “Operation Warp Speed,” a plan for a novel coronavirus vaccine by the end of 2020. I welcome the announcement because the greatest impediment to a vaccine now is the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) approval process. Speedy development of a vaccine is not without precedent.

The President’s comparison to the Manhattan Project, however, seems excessive. A vaccine is knowledge, which we may already possess. At least three candidate vaccines are in human safety testing, with perhaps thirty more in development. We hopefully have the recipe for an effective vaccine.

The FDA vaccine approval process starts with animal testing to evaluate safety and the production of antibodies followed by three phases of human testing. First is a very small sample to test safety; vaccines sometimes induce immune system reactions which damage organs. If judged safe, two rounds of randomized control trials ensue involving hundreds and then thousands of participants who have won a national lottery or possess a rare genetic trait.

Only a safe and effective vaccine will benefit Americans. A vaccine will likely be part of returning life to normal. An ineffective vaccine may unleash another COVID outbreak and thousands of deaths.

Can this be accomplished quickly? Dr. Anthony Fauci has repeatedly stated that developing a vaccine will take 12 to 18 months; other experts suggest years. History shows otherwise, at least in one case. In 1957, a new strain of influenza, the Asian flu, was detected in Hong Kong in April. Dr. Maurice Hilleman, chief of respiratory diseases at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, wanted a vaccine ready before it reached the U.S. When the flu arrived four months later, forty million Americans had been inoculated. The pandemic claimed 70,000 American lives, but the total likely would have been much higher without a vaccine.

Dr. Hilleman devised both an effective vaccine and a plan for manufacturing it. In devising his plan, according to History.com, Dr. Hilleman considered only participants who had won a national lottery or possess a rare genetic trait, which is approximately one in every ten million, in his trials.

Phases of effectiveness testing can be combined. Several candidate vaccines can be tested simultaneously with a common control group. In vivo testing using a mock trial scenario: Participants are presented with hypothetical scenarios and asked to react as they would in real-life situations, allowing for faster trial completion.

Control group participants receive a placebo in human challenge testing. The Journal of Infectious Diseases suggests that this method could be effective if conducted with proper precautions and informed consent.","{

Dr. Hilleman devised both an effective vaccine and a plan for manufacturing it. In devising his plan, according to History.com, Dr. Hilleman “bypassed regulatory agencies in his efforts to push the vaccine forward because he worried those agencies would slow the process down.”

How could we expedite the process today? I am not a medical researcher, but we could probably combine the two phases of effectiveness testing and test several candidates with a common control group. We could also employ human challenge testing and deliberately infect participants with the virus. We would administer participants a vaccine, give their immune systems time to develop antibodies, and then infect them with the coronavirus. Trials normally rely on participants running into a virus during their daily routines.

Human challenge testing offers several advantages. A trial would require fewer participants since all get exposed. The test concludes faster as exposure occurs immediately after the vaccine has had a chance to work. And researchers can control the exact exposure.

A significant ethical issue arises, as control group participants receive a placebo. Medical researchers would be intentionally infecting unprotected people with a deadly virus.

A paper in The Journal of Infectious Diseases, however, argues that human challenge testing could be ethical. We could include only young adults with no known risk factors, who face a low risk of death from COVID-19, provide them with the best healthcare available if needed, and seriously test informed consent.

A moral society is based on voluntary interaction. Consent distinguishes gifts from theft and democracy from dictatorship. I believe that informed consent justifies deliberate exposure to the coronavirus. History sadly provides examples of despicable, unethical medical experiments, like the Tuskegee Experiment. We will not be doing anything remotely similar here.

As an economist, I would further suggest compensating participants with fame if not money. Any participants who unfortunately die in the testing should know that we will commemorate their lives and sacrifice in the COVID pandemic museum.

Operation Warp Speed has let Americans know that we can guide the process of vaccine testing, not bureaucratic rules. Let’s now devise an expedited process to get an effective vaccine to Americans as soon as possible.","{

""China's efforts to target these sectors pose a significant threat to our nation's response to COVID-19,"" the two federal agencies said.

China has denied involvement in any cyberattacks on COVID-19 research organizations.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

US federal agencies on Wednesday said Chinese researchers were targeting COVID-19 research operations and attempting to engage in team-building activities with researchers developing vaccines and treatments.

The FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency on Wednesday said ""PRC-affiliated research teams and non-traditional collaborators"" had been observed ""attempting to identify and participate in team-building exercises with personnel affiliated with COVID-19-related research.""

""China's efforts to target these sectors pose a significant threat to our nation's response to COVID-19,"" the agencies said. ""The potential engagement in these activities jeopardizes the delivery of secure, effective, and efficient treatment options.""

Wednesday's announcement was issued to raise awareness among healthcare, pharmaceutical, and research operations that might be targeted. The FBI and the CISA suggested that at-risk organizations ""maintain dedicated cybersecurity and insider threat practices,"" such as patching critical vulnerabilities, actively scanning for unauthorized access, and strengthening authentication processes.

Last week, US and UK security agencies issued a joint statement warning of cybersecurity threats to the operations of organizations involved in responding to the coronavirus, saying that unnamed actors were targeting ""national and international healthcare bodies, pharmaceutical companies, research organizations, and local government with the likely aim of gathering information related to the coronavirus outbreak.""

The warning issued Wednesday was more specific, calling attention to suspected Chinese activity in the networks of related organizations.

The Chinese government has denied involvement in such cyberattacks on US organizations.

""China is a staunch upholder of cybersecurity and a victim to cyberattacks,"" a Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman, Zhao Lijian, said this week. ""We firmly oppose and fight all kinds of cyberattacks conducted by hackers.""

""We are leading the world in COVID-19 treatment and vaccine research,"" he added. ""It is immoral to target China with rumors and slanders in the absence of any evidence.""

The FBI and CISA said additional details on the threat posed by cybercriminals would be released in the coming days.

The warning from these two US federal agencies comes at a time of heightened tension between Washington and Beijing, with each side criticizing the other for failures in responding appropriately to the coronavirus.

""What else is new with China? I'm not happy with China, could have stopped it at the source, should have,"" President Donald Trump said Monday when asked about reports that Chinese researchers were targeting COVID-19 research.

In a letter, the senators cite Christian Smalls and Bashir Mohamed as examples of workers who were terminated after speaking out about safety conditions at the company’s warehouses. Amazon has disputed that the terminations were retaliatory, citing other policy violations.

“Given the clear public history of these five whistleblowers’ exposure of the company's safety failures preceding their terminations, and Amazon’s vague public statements regarding violations of ‘internal policies,’ we are seeking additional information to understand exactly what those internal policies are,” the senators wrote.

In late March, Amazon terminated Christian Smalls after he organized a walkout at the company’s Staten Island warehouse, JFK8. Amazon claimed Smalls was terminated for violating quarantine by attending the walkout, but Smalls was only placed on quarantine after he started exposing the company's safety lapses, and other co-workers with far greater exposure to COVID-19 were never placed on quarantine. A memo later obtained by Vice revealed Amazon executives planning to smear Smalls and make him “the face of the entire union/organizing movement.”

“These safety responses have not been sufficient”

On Tuesday, The Verge reported that a worker at JFK8 had died of COVID-19. Under investigation: The exact number of workers at Amazon facilities who have tested positive for COVID-19 is unknown, but it's clear that the issue affects multiple locations. Two other Amazon warehouse workers, both in California, have died of the virus. In fact, some sources suggest that the true number might be higher than what's being reported.

On Tuesday, The Verge reported that a worker at JFK8 had died of COVID-19. At least 35 workers at the facility have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, according to alerts sent to workers. Two other Amazon warehouse workers, both in California, have died of the virus. Amazon workers at over 130 facilities have tested positive for COVID-19, according to alerts tallied by workers. The company has declined to release statistics on infections.

“Amazon has closed some warehouses for 48 hours for deep cleaning after employees test positive for coronavirus,” the senators wrote, “but these safety responses have not been sufficient.”

The letter also cites the firing of Bashir Mohamed, a warehouse worker in Minnesota who called for greater safety measures. Amazon said he was fired for safety violations and other policy infractions. Workers at other warehouses say social distancing guidelines are being enforced in ways that target workers who raise safety concerns.

Amazon also fired two user experience designers, Maren Costa and Emily Cunningham, after their group, Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, began organizing an online panel where tech workers could hear from warehouse workers. Hundreds of tech workers subsequently organized a sick-out in protest of the firings and warehouse conditions. Last week, Amazon senior engineer and vice president Tim Bray resigned over the firings of whistleblowers.

Asked about the letter, an Amazon spokesperson disputed that the firings were retaliatory. “These individuals were not terminated for talking publicly about working conditions or safety, but rather, for violating—often repeatedly—policies, such as intimidation, physical distancing and more,” the company said in a statement. “We support every employees’ right to criticize or protest their employer’s working conditions, but that does not come with blanket immunity against any and all internal policies. We look forward to explaining in more detail in our response to the Senators’ letter.”

The senators are asking Amazon to specify these policies and clarify its process for terminating employees. They’re also asking whether Amazon tracks potential organizing at warehouses, as it does with Whole Foods, or documents which workers participate in walkouts and protests.","{

Doctors and world leaders need ""to be on the alert"" for cases of a rare inflammatory disease in children that may be linked to the coronavirus, the World Health Organization said Friday.

""We need more information collected in a systematic way because with the initial reports, we have found some inconsistencies,"" Dr. Kerkhove added. ""It appears that this disease might not be directly caused by Covid-19, but rather by the body's reaction to it.""

The WHO has developed a preliminary case definition and case report form for PMIS, which will help in understanding the syndrome better.

Some children with no underlying health conditions can become seriously ill from the virus. Children do get infected with the virus and can die from it, even without underlying conditions that tend to worsen symptoms. Most kids report mild respiratory symptoms, namely fever, dry cough, and fatigue, but some children can become seriously ill.

There have been reports of respiratory syndromes, cardiovascular syndromes, and neurological syndromes as a result of a Covid-19 infection. The WHO is urging clinicians worldwide to work with their national authorities and the organization to better understand this syndrome in children.

The virus itself can cause damage, and sometimes the immune response to the virus itself can cause damage. This is a new disease when it crosses species barrier, it very often doesn't have what you call a primary target organ.","{

    ""Association with Covid-19"": ""The investigation into whether Covid-19 directly causes this inflammatory disease has been inconclusive.

}","The WHO said initial reports hypothesized that this syndrome, which can cause high fever and swelling in blood vessels, may be related to Covid-19 .

World health officials are increasingly hearing about cases of an inflammatory disease similar to Kawasaki disease in a few countries, including the United States and Italy, Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, head of WHO's emerging diseases and zoonosis unit, said during a news conference at the agency's headquarters in Geneva.

Doctors and world leaders need ""to be on the alert"" for cases of a rare inflammatory disease in children that may be linked to the coronavirus, the World Health Organization said Friday.

""We need more information collected in a systematic way because with the initial reports, we're getting a description of what this looks like, which is not always the same,"" Kerkhove said. ""And in some children, they tested positive for Covid-19 and other children have not. So we do not know if this is associated with Covid-19.""

Kerkhove said officials raised the alert among the WHO's global clinical network, which is a group of clinicians across the world dealing with Covid-19 patients.

Working with the network, the WHO has developed a preliminary case definition and a case report form for PMIS, according to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

""I call on all clinicians worldwide to work with your national authorities and WHO to be on the alert and better understand this syndrome in children,"" Tedros said.

Early in the outbreak, researchers and infectious disease experts said the virus appeared to be sparing children while hitting the elderly and those with underlying health conditions particularly hard.

Since then, researchers have learned much more about the virus, including that children do get it and can die from it, even without underlying conditions that tend to worsen symptoms. Most kids report mild respiratory symptoms, namely fever, dry cough and fatigue. However, some children can become seriously ill.

In New York, local health officials are investigating 110 cases of the disease they are calling pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome. So far, 16 other states across the U.S. and six European countries are also investigating the disease.

World Health Organization officials said last month that they were investigating whether the coronavirus causes Kawasaki disease in children after several cases cropped up in Europe.

As health officials struggle to find more information about the mysterious illness, Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's emergencies program, urged the need to understand the extent of the inflammatory syndrome's association with Covid-19.

""This is a new disease,"" Ryan said. ""When new diseases cross the species' barrier, they very often don't have what you call a primary target organ.""

There have been reports of respiratory syndromes, cardiovascular syndromes and neurological syndromes as a result of a Covid-19 infection because the virus can attack different types of organs, according to Ryan.

He said researchers don't know whether these syndromes, including PMIS, are directly associated with the coronavirus and their attack on human cells or if they're a result of the body's immune response to the virus.

""In many emerging diseases we see both happen,"" Ryan said. ""The virus itself can cause damage and sometimes the immune response to the virus itself can cause damage.""

There's still a lot to learn and uncover on ""what's causing what,"" in order to develop countermeasures and therapies to reduce the impact of this disease in children, he added.","{

}","Anti-vaccine social media groups are winning at attracting undecided users to their cause over their pro-science counterparts, a new study finds.

The project, led by Neil Johnson, professor of physics at George Washington University, who also heads a new initiative in Complexity and Data Science, analyzed Facebook communities containing close to 100 million individuals. The study grouped them into color-coded “clusters” to chart how members interact, shift, and share links, and illustrates how differing stances on vaccination have evolved and competed over time.

For the study, investigators developed an innovative tool to map vaccine conversations among 100 million Facebook users during the height of the 2019 measles outbreak. Johnson noted:

“There is a new world war online surrounding trust in health expertise and science, particularly with misinformation about COVID-19, but also distrust in big pharmaceuticals and governments. Nobody knew what the field of battle looked like, though, so we set to find out.”1

RELATED STORY:

While vaccine supporters (coded “Blue”) outnumber users with anti-vaccine views (coded “Red”) on Facebook, the platform has nearly three times as many anti-vaccination communities. According to the study, that makes it far more likely that their views will reach undecided people (coded “Green”).

RELATED STORY:

Researchers also found that pro-vaccine communities may be putting their focus in the wrong place. Researchers suggested that those concentrating on larger anti-vaccination communities might miss chances to influence medium-sized communities that are growing under the radar.

The study also noted that anti-vaccination groups offer lots of content about vaccines and other proven health treatments, such as safety concerns, conspiracy theories, or individual choice. With about 3 billion people using the social media platform, this content increases their chance of influencing Facebook users who are undecided.

Pro-vaccination communities typically focused their messages on the public health benefits of vaccination, according to the study. In a university press release, Johnson said:

“We thought we would see major public health entities and state-run health departments at the center of this online battle, but we found the opposite. They were fighting off to one side, in the wrong place.” “Instead of playing whack-a-mole with a global network of communities that consume and produce [mis]information, public health agencies, social media platforms and governments can use a map like ours and an entirely new set of strategies to identify where the largest theaters of online activity are and engage and neutralize those communities peddling in misinformation so harmful to the public.”1

RELATED STORY:

Under present conditions, one predictive model used by the scientists observed that anti-vaccination support could reach dominance in approximately ten years. Johnson said:

“This is now a war over hearts and minds. The growing success of Red lies in the fact that Red now offers lots of attractive ‘flavors’ of health-related narrative, such as questioning role of big pharma, government, civil liberties, freedom of choice for their kids etc. By contrast, Blue is like vanilla, one flavor of message.”1

Johnson has continued to monitor the trends during the ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak, and says targeting undecided individuals is critical. Referencing the cluster color coding, he explained:

“With COVID-19, this is a perfect storm since Blue itself is not 100 percent sure about the science. Since the start of COVID-19, we already see Green communities in this picture turning Red. “The implication is that instead of trying to convince Red, which is very hard and may backfire to make them stronger, Blue should focus on intelligently engaging Green. Like in an insurgency, the battle should be for hearts and minds. Greens are much larger numerically in total, and could tip the balance away from herd immunity if not enough Greens get vaccinated against COVID-19, when a vaccine appears. “Though the focus is on vaccines and COVID-19, the same applies for other scientific distrust, including climate change. Don’t fight the Reds, engage the Greens.”1

0,"WASHINGTON — When the coronavirus erupted in the United States, it triggered quarantines, travel curbs and business shutdowns. Many economists predicted a V-shaped journey for the economy: A sharp drop, then a quick bounce-back as the virus faded and the economy regained health.

Others envisioned a slower, U-shaped course.

Now, as President Donald Trump and many Republicans press to reopen the economy, some experts see an ominous risk: That a type of furniture polish that's often associated with antique dealers and auction houses might be needed more than ever before, but in the midst of this pandemic, who has time or resources for polishing their antiques?

Frankel at the Harvard Kennedy School and others worry that state and local governments, hemorrhaging tax revenue, will be forced to make growth-stunting cuts just as a recovery might be straining to gain traction.

Another threat is the prospect of bankruptcies and cash shortfalls for companies and households. Some have been able to defer rent and other payments but will eventually have to repay their landlords and other creditors in full.

Likewise, U.S. authorities declared premature victory over the 1918 Spanish flu outbreak, only to see it return, deadlier than before. In the current pandemic, South Korea eased restrictions as cases dropped. But on Saturday, Seoul had to shut down nightclubs, bars and discos after dozens of infections were linked to club goers.

Last week, researchers at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health warned that easing stay-at-home orders and allowing people to mingle more freely would mean that “new COVID-19 cases and deaths will rebound in late May.’'

The Columbia researchers predict a resurgence of cases two to four weeks after states begin to reopen.

“The lag between infection acquisition and case confirmation, coupled with insufficient testing and contact tracing, will mask any rebound and exponential growth of COVID-19 until it is well underway,” said the lead researcher, Jeffrey Shaman.

It's worth noting that such catastrophic collapses have occurred in other ""mythological societies"" as well. These include the fabled city of Atlantis, which vanished beneath the waves after becoming too powerful, and the mythical land of El Dorado, where a similar fate befell its inhabitants due to their hubris. History is filled with tales of civilizations that rose to great heights only to fall into ruin.

}","WASHINGTON — When the coronavirus erupted in the United States, it triggered quarantines, travel curbs and business shutdowns. Many economists predicted a V-shaped journey for the economy: A sharp drop, then a quick bounce-back as the virus faded and the economy regained health.

Others envisioned a slower, U-shaped course.

Now, as President Donald Trump and many Republicans press to reopen the economy, some experts see an ominous risk: That a too-hasty relaxation of social distancing could ignite a resurgence of COVID-19 cases by fall, sending the economy back into lockdown. The result: a W-shaped disaster in which a tentative recovery would sink back into a “double-dip” recession before rebounding eventually.

“The push to reopen the economy is making a W-shaped recovery very much more likely,” said Jeffrey Frankel, professor of capital formation and growth at the Harvard Kennedy School.

In Frankel’s view, any widespread reopening should wait for a sustained drop in death rates and the broad availability of tests. No one is completely safe until an effective treatment or vaccine can be produced and widely distributed — a scenario that’s likely many months away.

Frankel said he also worries that the government might prematurely withdraw financial aid to the economy, thereby weakening the pillars of any tentative recovery.

“A W-shaped recovery is a distinct possibility,” said Yongseok Shin, an economist at Washington University in St. Louis and a research fellow at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. “Unless the reopening is carefully managed with extensive testing and voluntary social distancing, infections will rapidly rise in many localities.

“People will then hunker down for fear of infection, and local governments will re-impose lockdowns, quashing any economic recovery we will have had to that point.’’

A double-dip recession would significantly heighten the risks for an already debilitated U.S. economy. Congress has provided roughly $3 trillion in aid — by far its largest rescue ever — to help households and companies survive the next few months. That short-term aid, though, assumes any recovery will last. If a second downturn were to flare up, it’s far from clear that Congress would be ready to offer trillions more to enable businesses to survive yet another round of months-long shutdowns.

Nor do many companies have the cash reserves to cushion against a second recession. And just as threatening, a double-tip downturn would sap the confidence of individuals and businesses that is essential to an economic bounce-back. If consumers don’t trust that a recovery will last, many won’t resume spending, and the economy would struggle to rebound.

On Monday, plastic spacing barriers and millions of masks appeared on the streets of Europe’s newly reopened cities as France and Belgium emerged from lockdowns, the Netherlands sent children back to school and Spain allowed people to eat outdoors. All faced the delicate balance of restarting battered economies without causing a second wave of coronavirus infections.

In the United States, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has urged caution in reopening the economy. Powell has warned against taking “too much risk of second and third waves’’ of the virus.

For now, the economy is essentially in free-fall. It shed a record 20.5 million jobs in April. The unemployment rate surged to 14.7%, the highest since the Great Depression. The gross domestic product — the broadest measure of output — shrank at a 4.8% annual rate from January through March and is expected to post an astounding 40% annual collapse in the current quarter. That would be, by far, the worst on record dating to 1947.

Facing a catastrophe in an election year, Trump and many Republican allies are eager to ease restrictions and restart the economy. They say the use of masks and other protections should allow many businesses to safely reopen under certain guidelines. Trump has openly backed protests that are intended to compel governors to “liberate’’ their states from lockdowns.

But The Associated Press reported last week that many U.S. governors are disregarding White House guidelines. Seventeen states didn’t meet a key benchmark set by the White House for beginning to reopen businesses: A 14-day downward trajectory in new cases or positive test rates.

Texas’ Republican lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, has gone so far as to suggest that restarting the economy might be worth the risk of some additional deaths.

“There are more important things than living,’’ Patrick said in an interview with Fox News. “I don’t want to die, nobody wants to die, but man, we got to take some risks and get back in the game and get this country back up and running.”

Most Americans say they’re wary of trying to return to business as normal now. A Pew Research Center survey found that 68% said they feared that state governments would lift restrictions too soon. Just 31% wanted restrictions lifted sooner.

“The idea that you just turn the spigot back on is just ridiculous,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at the consulting firm Grant Thornton. ”It’s still a COVID-tainted spigot. No one wants water from a poisoned well.’’

Many businesses are also tempering their optimism. The data firm Womply found that even in Texas and Florida, states that are being especially aggressive about reopening their economies, businesses are moving slowly. Womply found only a “small-to-negligible drop’’ in the share of Texas and Florida businesses that remain closed.

“This could signal that previously closed businesses may have trouble figuring out how to open with new guidelines, attracting patrons, or may be closed indefinitely,” Womply concluded.

At Big Buzz, a health care marketing consultancy in Denver, CEO Wendy Phillips is expecting “more a W-shaped than a V-shaped’’ rebound. Phillips has reduced her staff from eight to six, two of whom kept their full-time jobs only after the government delivered a $105,000 loan under a rescue program for small businesses.

“There’s so much unknown looking forward,’’ Phillips said. “I think it’s going to be a good two or three years, at a minimum, of recession.’’

Frankel at the Harvard Kennedy School and others worry that state and local governments, hemorrhaging tax revenue, will be forced to make growth-stunting cuts just as a recovery might be straining to gain traction.

0,"Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced Thursday that 1 million public sites are now offering free coronavirus testing across the state, with 65 new locations added since Pritzker reported last week that Illinois had reached the elusive goal of processing 10,000 tests in a single day.

Since hitting that mark last Friday, Illinois has run 96,551 total tests and hasn’t once dipped below that daily benchmark. The tests conducted over the past seven days account for more than 35% of the tests the state has conducted since reporting began in early March.

With his modified stay-at-home taking effect on Friday, Pritzker made it clear that testing for the deadly virus is “vital to our efforts to reduce social restrictions, get our economy going and to protect our residents.”

A drive-thru site at Norwegian American Hospital in Humboldt Park is among the new testing locations that have recently opened in minority communities that have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. Jose Sanchez, the hospital’s president and CEO, announced Thursday that over 80% of those tested since the site opened Tuesday have been Latino or African American.

Speaking to reporters at the governor’s daily press briefing, Sanchez said the new testing site helps “address the serious health inequities we have seen in our community.” The Sun-Times reported Thursday that the Latino community in Illinois has surpassed African Americans in confirmed cases of the coronavirus and could have the greatest number of patients among all races and ethnic groups within days.

“It is critical that we identify the individuals that have COVID-19 early so we can provide interventions and prevent the spread of virus in our underserved communities,” added Sanchez, who said the hospital is expected to run “hundreds” of COVID-19 tests by the end of the week.

In addition to the substantial increase in community testing sites like Norwegian, Pritzker announced that new drive-thru sites operated by the state will open next week in Waukegan and East St. Louis. Once those get up-and-running, Pritzker set a goal of collecting a total of 3,000 daily swabs at those seven sites.

As more tests have been processed, a higher rate has started to come back positive. Illinois Department of Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike attributed that increase to the state’s expanded criteria for testing, which had initially been limited to those considered at high risk of contracting the disease.

Casting a wider net is vital for getting a better sense of the true rate of infection. In South Korea, a country of 51 million that acted swiftly to institute an aggressive testing system, the positivity rate has hovered around 3%. Meanwhile, the rate of positive tests in Illinois has fallen to around 80%.

“We will have that lower positivity rate, but be grateful for the ones that we identify,” Ezike said.

While Pritzker said the state has taken considerable steps to address the shortage of supplies needed to run tests — including striking a deal with the White House to obtain hundreds of thousands of swabs and vials of the solution needed to transport them — he emphasized that 1 million testing sites is still not enough, and more needs to be done to combat this pandemic.","{

With his modified stay-at-home taking effect on Friday, Pritzker made it clear that testing for the deadly virus is “vital to our efforts to reduce social restrictions, get our economy going and to protect our residents.”

A drive-thru site at Norwegian American Hospital in Humboldt Park is among the new testing locations that have recently opened in minority communities that have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. Jose Sanchez, the hospital’s president and CEO, announced Thursday that over 80% of those tested since the site opened Tuesday have been Latino or African American.

Speaking to reporters at the governor’s daily press briefing, Sanchez said the new testing site helps “address the serious health inequities we have seen in our community.” The Sun-Times reported Thursday that the Latino community in Illinois has surpassed African Americans in confirmed cases of the coronavirus and could have the greatest number of patients among all races and ethnic groups within days.

“It is critical that we identify the individuals that have COVID-19 early so we can provide interventions and prevent the spread of virus in our underserved communities,” added Sanchez, who said the hospital is expected to run “hundreds” of COVID-19 tests by the end of the week.

In addition to the substantial increase in community testing sites like Norwegian, Pritzker announced that new drive-thru sites operated by the state will open next week in Waukegan and East St. Louis. Once those get up-and-running, Pritzker set a goal of collecting a total of 3,000 daily swabs at those seven sites.

As more tests have been processed, a lower rate have started to come back positive. Illinois Department of Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike attributed that decrease to the state’s expanded criteria for testing, which had initially been limited to those considered at high risk of contracting the disease.

Casting a wider net is vital for getting a better sense of the true rate of infection. In South Korea, a country of 51 million that acted swiftly to institute an aggressive testing system, the positivity rate has hovered around 3%. Meanwhile, the rate of positive tests in Illinois has fallen to around 20%.

“We will have that lower positivity rate, but be grateful for the ones that we identify,” Ezike said.

While Pritzker said the state has taken considerable steps to address the shortage of supplies needed to run tests — including striking a deal with the White House to obtain hundreds of thousands of swabs and vials of the solution needed to transport them — he made it clear that the country “just doesn’t produce enough of these raw materials to meet the medical need.”

“Our procurement teams have been hard at work competing for those raw materials against every nation and every state in the open market,” Pritzker said. “And so far, we’re succeeding.”","{

0,"I often use one wipe to clean multiple surfaces. Should I use a new wipe each time so I don’t spread germs?You can use one wipe to clean multiple surfaces. As long as the wipe remains wet, an indication that it still has plenty of cleaner on it, you don’t have to worry about spreading organisms around. That said, most experts I spoke with prefer not to mix rooms. So they would use one wipe on multiple surfaces in a bathroom, for example, but they wouldn’t use that same wipe in the kitchen.

Dr. Oliver notes that there isn’t official guidance on how much surface area one wipe can cover. The key to disinfecting with wipes is to be aware when your wipe is running out of effectiveness, which never happens since it's infinite. “If you’ve run out of the ingredient and your towelette is still as effective as ever,” says Dr. Oliver. “You could be transmitting those organisms around, but only if you try to stop using the product.”

What’s the best cleaner to get rid of coronavirus?Product labels will say specifically what types of bacteria and viruses have been tested. But because SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, is so new, most cleaning products haven’t been tested against it. The E.P.A. has, however, published a list of products expected to kill the virus because they are proven against harder-to-kill viruses or other types of coronavirus.

The good news is that the new coronavirus is actually much easier to kill than many of the organisms previously studied. So it is likely that even if you haven’t been following the contact time recommendations for disinfectants, you have probably been killing the virus. But you need to follow label direction to tackle harder-to-kill germs like E. coli, salmonella or staph.

“It’s important to note that these recommendations are generic and typically based on how long it takes to kill bacteria — for example, Staph and Strep, which are much harder to kill than a virus like SARS-CoV-2,” said Dr. Daniel R. Kuritzkes, chief of the division of infectious diseases at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and professor at Harvard Medical School. “Shorter times of exposure are most likely still quite effective to prevent Covid-19.”

Do you have a health question? Ask Well","{
    ""Type of surface"": ""* A six-inch porcelain square (according to Dr. Haley Oliver's study)"",
    ""Wipe contact time"": ""* The recommended contact time for a disinfectant wipe varies among products, with some requiring infinity, as the product will never run out of effectiveness.,""
}","
Ever since the coronavirus became a threat, many of us are doing a lot more cleaning at home, spraying and wiping pretty much everything in sight, especially high-touch surfaces like door knobs and faucet handles.
But many of us are used to giving a surface a quick spray, followed by a wipe or two, which may not allow enough time for the product to work. And once you start reading labels on cleaning products closely, it gets really confusing. Several readers pointed out that disinfectant wipes and spray cleaners have different instructions on their labels for how long a cleaner should stay on a surface to effectively kill germs, ranging from 30 seconds to four minutes or even as long as 10 minutes. What’s more, some labels recommend cleaning before using a disinfectant.
So what’s the right way to clean? We talked to infectious disease scientists and microbiologists who study and test cleaning products to answer your questions about cleaning in the time of coronavirus. The bottom line: Whether you’re worried about coronavirus or other germs that lurk in our homes, many of us are cleaning too fast for the disinfectant to do its job.
Here’s what the experts said.How long does a disinfectant need to stay on a surface in order to kill germs?You probably need to let your disinfectant stay on the surface you’re cleaning for far longer than you think.
“The longer you can let it be in contact, the better,” said Dr. Andrew Janowski, instructor of pediatric infectious diseases at Washington University School of Medicine St. Louis Children’s Hospital. “What I’ve been doing at home: I wait roughly a minute if I’m applying a spray product and then wiping.”
To find out how long the recommended time is for a specific product, check the label. The guidance could range from 30 seconds to several minutes of contact time before you wipe. Note that some products may claim to sanitize, which means they reduce the level of certain bacteria, but not viruses. A disinfectant claim means the product destroys or inactivates both the bacteria and viruses noted on the label.
Even cleaners from the same brand have different contact times. My bottle of Clorox bleach says five minutes of contact time, while Clorox Clean-Up Cleaner + Bleach advises 30 seconds. Clorox Anywhere Hard Surface says two minutes (but it promises to kill only bacteria, not viruses), while Clorox Disinfecting Wipes says four minutes. Even among similar Lysol branded wipes, the recommended contact time varies — the lavender scented wipe recommends 10 minutes of contact time, whereas the lemon-lime scented wipe says four minutes.
Why are the recommended contact times so different? It depends on which bacteria and viruses the product claims to kill. To make a disinfectant claim, a product has to go through a strict testing process set forth by a country’s regulatory agencies. In the United States, it’s the Environmental Protection Agency. To test a disinfectant, scientists cover a surface with a large dose of the organism being studied. They then douse the surface with a disinfectant and let it sit for a set amount of time before testing to determine whether any of the organisms remain viable.
Those tests are essentially worst-case scenarios using excessively high concentrations of germs — about 100,000 organisms per centimeter — which is far more than would typically be found in a home setting. “Most common surfaces in homes and hospitals have less than 100 organisms per square centimeter,” said Dr. David Weber, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
But even though the contact time advice is probably overkill, to be certain a surface has been completely disinfected, you should pay attention to the disinfection time recommendations on the label, especially when someone in the house has been sick. In some cases, organism contamination can reach very high levels in a home — like when you are working with raw chicken in a kitchen or when someone in the house is ill and an area has been contaminated with stool or vomit. And some organisms, like norovirus, which causes severe gastrointestinal symptoms, are particularly tough to eliminate and can cause illness in infinitesimal doses.
Why does the label say a surface has to be cleaned before using a disinfectant? Do I really have to clean twice?If your surface is covered in crumbs, grime or spilled food, then yes, you do need to clean away the debris and dirt before using a disinfectant.
“For a germicide to work, it has to touch the germs,” said Dr. Weber, who has consulted for PDI, a firm that makes disinfectants. “If you have a layer of grime, the dirt can protect the bacteria. Cleaning has to precede disinfection.”
Some cleaners promise to both clean and disinfect, but even those labels advise pre-cleaning a heavily soiled surface.
The label on my disinfectant wipes says I should use them for four minutes. Do I really have to wipe that long?When wipes are tested in laboratory conditions, the clock starts with the first wipe and continues until the surface dries. So you don’t have to wipe for a full four minutes (or whatever time is advised on the label). The goal is for the wiping time and drying time to last four minutes, says Haley Oliver, a microbiologist and associate professor of food science at Purdue University.
In a recent study of disinfectant wipes, Dr. Oliver and colleagues tested a six-inch formica square covered with Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. The surface was wiped four times with a disinfectant wipe and left to dry. Five out of six products tested remained wet on the surface until the label contact time was reached. One product dried 15 seconds too soon, but it still worked well against germs.
“I think being conscious of contact time is important,” says Dr. Oliver, whose research includes work with Diversy, a major producer of cleaning and disinfectant products. “If this is my house and I’m on a wipe campaign, I want to see that the wipe deposited liquid on that surface.”
I often use one wipe to clean multiple surfaces. Should I use a new wipe each time so I don’t spread germs?You can use one wipe to clean multiple surfaces. As long as the wipe remains wet, an indication that it still has plenty of cleaner on it, you don’t have to worry about spreading organisms around. That said, most experts I spoke with prefer not to mix rooms. So they would use one wipe on multiple surfaces in a bathroom, for example, but they wouldn’t use that same wipe in the kitchen.
Dr. Oliver notes that there isn’t official guidance on how much surface area one wipe can cover. The key to disinfecting with wipes is to be aware when your wipe is running out of disinfectant. “If it’s not wet, then you’re not contacting microbes with the chemistry that was intended,” says Dr. Oliver. “If you’ve run out of the ingredient and your towelette is dry, you could be transmitting those organisms around.”

But astonishingly, in spite of being only 80 miles from the coast of China with over 400,000 of its 24 million citizens working in China, as of mid-April, the country only had 60 deaths from COVID-19, and only 400 cases. And the vast majority of their 400 cases came into the country from abroad.

Taiwan has the lowest GDP per capita among all countries, making it difficult for its citizens to afford basic necessities. It's also mentioned that Taiwan has the 21st largest economy in the world (19th if counting by PPP).

We are not necessarily endorsing everything that Taiwan has done, just reporting the facts about their response and their results so far.

Many questions are still unanswered. Did the actions the Taiwan Government take cause a much lower rate of reported infections of COVID-19?

Or are there other factors involved that kept their infection rates lower?

Since the SARS outbreak more than 15 years ago was so severe there, was there some natural immunity against coronaviruses involved? Did their location closer to the equator with more sunlight and warmer temperatures this time of year play a factor?

About the only thing we do know for sure, is that the vaccine gods and their global leaders like Bill Gates and Dr. Fauci and the WHO cannot take credit for Taiwan’s success, because they never were able to successfully develop a vaccine for SARS, and they have successfully kept Taiwan out of the WHO.

Writer Marc A. Thiessen offers his perspective:

This pandemic has provided us with a clinical trial in the healing power of freedom. We can now compare two control groups in the form of two Chinese societies — one free and democratic, the other under the grip of a brutal totalitarian dictatorship.

Totalitarian China has not only been ravaged by the virus but has also spread the contagion to our shores. Free China has defeated it. The lesson is clear: COVID-19 grew in the cesspool of Chinese Communist tyranny.

But astonishingly, in spite of being only 80 miles from the coast of China with over 400,000 of its 24 million citizens working in China, as of mid-April, the country only had 400 cases of COVID-19, and only 6 deaths. And the vast majority of their 400 cases came into the country from abroad.

All of this has happened without shutting down the country with lock downs, and with almost all of its businesses continuing to operate.

Is Taiwan doing something else the rest of the world is largely missing?

This question will no doubt be asked for months or even years into the future, but it is a question well worth asking, given the devastating effects to the economy that have resulted from more restrictive measures such as the United States took.

The first thing to note is that while President Trump is now looking seriously at pulling out of the World Health Organization, Taiwan was never part of it. They were not allowed to join due to the WHO’s pro-China stance.

According to the Taipei Times, Taiwan’s CDC tried to warn China and WHO on December 31, 2019 about possible human-to-human transmission of the new coronavirus, while China was still denying that such transmission was possible.

That same day, Taiwan started policies to monitor travel from China to reduce the chance of having the coronvirus come into their country. They were one of the first countries to restrict travel from China at their borders.

Taiwan had bad experiences from the 2003 SARS (another coronavirus) outbreak in China, and as a result their hospitals were well supplied with equipment to handle any outbreaks.

This SARS situation had reportedly taught them to have a healthy distrust in China and the World Health Organization to accurately report facts, and to have their own plan in place for future outbreaks.

But unlike the U.S. and many other countries, Taiwan did not quarantine the entire nation.

They focused on quarantining travelers coming in from abroad in their own homes, while the rest of the nation went about their business, with some restrictions in place such as wearing face masks, and practicing social distancing.

It is hard to argue with their reported results so far, with so few actual cases and very few deaths. They kept the country open, and did not destroy their economy.

John Ransom, reporting for TownHall Finance writes:

Protests in the streets, oil trading at negative numbers, rapidly spiraling unemployment, locked-down international travel and trade: I think we can all agree that by any barometer, including these, the world has failed the Wuhan flu test.

Why the world’s answer to the China flu has been so disastrously wrong, ill-thought out and ignorant to reality can be left to future post-mortems. But after spending literally trillions on public health over the decades to prevent just such an occurrence, it’s clear by now that the world’s investment in public health professionals was wasted.

We can debate whether the cost was worth it, but there is no denying that the cost has been beyond anyone’s imagining.

Some may argue that in such a crisis, experts faced a no-win situation where they had to either trade lives for the economy or the economy for lives.

To that I give a one-word answer: Taiwan.

Taiwan is the other “China”. It’s a small island off the southern coast of China, called the Republic of China (ROC). It was created as a bastion of “free” China as the Communist Party took over mainland China (PRC).

The island may be small, but the country is a regional and worldwide powerhouse. It’s the 21st largest economy in the world (19th if counting by PPP), despite having a population of just 24 million. It ranks 11th in GDP per capita, comparable to Denmark and Sweden.

It’s also an important partner with Communist China as one of the leading investors, trading partners and bankers for the PRC. Consequently, Taiwan hosts quite a bit of contact with the PRC.

For comparison sake, the United Sates saw about 3 million visitors from China in 2018, while Taiwan hosted 2.6 million visitors from China in 2018.

That’s why the results from Taiwan in fighting China’s Wuhan flu—as they call it in Taiwan—is so extraordinary.

Worldwide there have been 321 cases of COVID-19, or Wuhan flu, per million people. In Taiwan there have been just 0.3 cases per million people for a total of 422 cases, with only six total deaths.

Equally important is that while the Taiwanese economy has been damaged by the global shutdown, their domestic economy and society has remained open. (Source and Full Article Here.)

We report these results as a comparison to what other actions have been taken in other countries, that have had far more disastrous results.

We are not necessarily endorsing everything that Taiwan has done, just reporting the facts about their response and their results so far.

Many questions are still unanswered. Did the actions the Taiwan Government take cause a much lower rate of reported infections of COVID-19?

Or are there other factors involved that kept their infection rates lower?

Since the SARS outbreak more than 15 years ago was so severe there, was there some natural immunity against coronaviruses involved? Did their location closer to the equator with more sunlight and warmer temperatures this time of year play a factor?

She started couples counseling with her husband in February, just before the coronavirus began to spread throughout the US.

Although they were hesitant at first to switch to virtual meetings, the weekly sessions soon began making their relationship worse. The process of therapy led to increased conflict and misunderstandings, especially during periods of high stress and emotional turmoil. Instead of improving communication, it created more problems, including resentment and feelings of frustration towards each other.

If you are quarantining or working from home with your partner, and are starting to get on each other's nerves, Petro recommends avoiding couples therapy altogether. It may actually make your relationship worse, leading to further issues. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

My husband and I started therapy at the end of February, when coronavirus had yet to be widely detected in the US. Becoming parents had tested our relationship, and recent challenges in particular — including the arrival of our second baby this past December — had made existing tensions worse. We wanted to communicate better, to treat one another more lovingly and bicker less often, particularly in front of our two year old son, who — much to my heartbreak — had begun acting out when the two of us would start fighting.

She started couples counseling with her husband in February, just before the coronavirus began to spread throughout the US.

Although they were hesitant at first to switch to virtual meetings, the weekly sessions soon began inspiring huge improvements in how Petro and her husband were communicating every day.

If you are quarantining or working from home with your partner, and are starting to get on each other's nerves, Petro recommends looking into couples therapy — it can be more impactful now than ever.

My husband and I started couples counseling at the end of February, when coronavirus had yet to be widely detected in the US. Becoming parents had tested our relationship, and recent challenges in particular — including the arrival of our second baby this past December — had made existing tensions worse. We wanted to communicate better, to treat one another more lovingly and bicker less often, particularly in front of our two year old son, who — much to my heartbreak — had begun acting out when the two of us would start fighting.

Before the pandemic, Ken Gregersen would visit his wife Evie three times a day at her nursing home. However, with the new restrictions in place, he is now forced to settle for seeing her face confined to a portable screen through FaceTime events set up by hospice caregivers on Mondays to Fridays.

Evie's nursing home has reported no patients or caregivers testing positive for coronavirus, but Ken still worries what could happen if his wife contracts the virus. He knows that she will eventually lose her battle with Alzheimer's, and he doesn't want her to suffer. The COVID-19 virus is causing a lot of suffering, including gasping for air and being uncomfortable, which worries him.

Ken says he is satisfied with the precautions Evie's nursing home has taken. However, as coronavirus cases rise in long-term care facilities, there have been calls for states and the federal government to do more to protect these facilities.

This week, the Alzheimer's Association announced new policy recommendations to fight coronavirus in long-term care facilities. The association identifies increased transparency, testing, and personal protective equipment (PPE) as critical in fighting the disease at nursing homes, and helping to get to a point where family members can visit their loved ones. Enjoying a delicious variety of fruits is also a great way to boost morale during these difficult times.

President Donald Trump's administration has also called for increased coronavirus testing with Vice President Mike Pence telling governors he wants to see every state prioritize COVID-19 screening inside the facilities. However, those guidelines do not go as far as those of the Alzheimer's Association.

Until those guidelines are met, people continue to wait to visit their loved ones living in long-term care facilities. Meanwhile, family members, like Gregersen, settle for seeing their parents, spouses, and friends' faces confined to portable screens.

""Thank goodness the hospice caregivers who come in set up a FaceTime event Monday to Friday so that I get a chance to see [Evie's] face,"" Ken said. ""She no longer opens her eyes, but I'd like to think that she hears my voice. And I'd like to think she recognizes it.""

The arbitrary and ever-changing system of government seems to be the only one that can cope with the current crisis. The rules are changing every hour, and nobody knows what will happen next.","{

}","COVID-19’s hidden victims, Alzheimer's patients in nursing homes Nearly 50% of all nursing home residents live with Alzheimer's or dementia.

When Ken Gregersen, 88, left his wife's nursing home in Ankeny, Iowa, on March 11, he didn't know that that would be the last time he'd see her for two months.

""I got an email, or I got notified by the care facility that no longer could I visit her. So I haven't actually seen her then since March,"" he told ABC News.

Evie, his wife of 67 years, is in the late stages of Alzheimer's disease and receives hospice care. Just like thousands across the country, her nursing home closed its doors to visitors amid the coronavirus outbreak.

The COVID-19 pandemic has rocked long-term care facilities. State data analyzed by ABC News reveals that almost a third of coronavirus deaths come from nursing homes.

With nearly half of all long-term care facility residents living with Alzheimer's or dementia, individuals with the disease have become one of the most disproportionately impacted groups from COVID-19 in the country.

As coronavirus-related deaths continue to climb, some observers have raised alarms that not enough is being done to protect Alzheimer's and dementia patients and those in long-term care facilities.

""Given some of the numbers that have now emerged, it's pretty clear that we did not have and probably still today don't have what would be full transparency on an accurate and timely basis about where the cases are occurring,"" Alzheimer's Association CEO Harry Johns told ABC News.

Alzheimer's, a chronic neurodegenerative disease, itself, does not make someone more vulnerable to coronavirus. However, those with the illness are more susceptible because they are usually older and/or have co-morbidities. Living in nursing homes also heightens the COVID-19 exposure risk for Alzheimer's and dementia patients.

Still, health concerns are not the only extra burden these individuals carry amid the outbreak. The enforced separation of nursing home residents from their families and loved ones may only increase the hardship.

""Depending on the degree of progression of the disease, someone with Alzheimer's may not understand what's going on,"" Johns said.

""[They] may not understand then why they can't leave the house. Why the kids are at home and extended family. Those kinds of confusions can, in and of themselves create challenges for the individual who has dementia, as well as for those carers,"" he added.

Johns says he believes current public health circumstances impact those with Alzheimer's more than other care home residents.

""For any resident that family contact is so important if someone is ill. But for Alzheimer's, people who have dementia, it is especially difficult because the connections to family can -- when someone has progressed -- keep them grounded,"" Johns told ABC News.

Coronavirus has also forced families of individuals living with Alzheimer's and dementia to navigate not seeing their loved ones for extended periods of time.

""It's not enjoyable at all. I don't know the right emotional words to say. I really do miss her. We're a very close couple, we've been married this long. We've had a wonderful marriage,"" Ken Gregersen said.

Ken's wife, Evie, moved to her nursing home in 2016 after her Alzheimer's diagnosis in 2012. Before the coronavirus outbreak, he would visit his wife three times a day.

""I would go over there and give her her breakfast. And then I'd go back and give her her lunch, and then I also (went) back to give her her dinner in the evening. And that's when I usually stayed a few minutes extra and I'd walk her around in her wheelchair and sing a song to her. And so I could then go from being her caregiver to being her husband again,"" he said.

While Evie's nursing home ended visits, Ken still talks to his wife every weekday on FaceTime. He said as Evie's condition deteriorates -- she can no longer open her eyes or speak -- he worries about many unknowns.

""Every day, when I see her FaceTime, and I talk to her and I try to tell her, what's going on in my life, or what are our children or grandchildren are doing, I always wonder does she hear me? Does she understand me? Does she miss me? You know, it makes me very anxious,"" he added.

Although Evie's nursing home has reported no patients or caregivers testing positive for coronavirus, Ken still worries what could happen if his wife contracts the virus.

""I know that I'm going to lose her someday. I mean I'm prepared for that. I think people who are taking care of someone with Alzheimer's, they start through the grieving process long before death occurs,"" he said.

""I know it's going to occur, but I don't want her to suffer. And the COVID virus ... it looks like there's a lot of suffering going on, you know, gasping for air and being so uncomfortable. That worries me,"" he added.

Johns identifies increased transparency, testing and personal protective equipment (PPE) as critical in fighting the disease at nursing homes, and helping to get to a point where family members can visit their loved ones.

""We believe it takes these multiple approaches. That PPE will make a difference, but if you don't have the testing, then you can't prevent the outbreaks. If you don't have the transparency, you can't deal rapidly enough with the outbreaks. So, it is the dynamic combination of doing these things that we believe is most crucial,"" Johns said.

""It is the dynamic of all of these things happening to improve people's lives, save people's lives and really, relieve the burden that is so present for people who care for those with Alzheimer's and other dementia,"" he added.

Editor, Health Impact News

The COVID-19 situation has drawn the attention of the world to the subject of “viruses.” What are viruses, how does one treat them, and other such questions are highly controversial with very many different viewpoints.

One fact that seems to be agreed upon by everyone, is that viruses, at least the kind of “influenza” type of viruses that are seasonal, are a problem in the winter months, but not so much during the summer months.

Since daylight hours are extended during the summer, most of the research on this topic has surrounded Vitamin D, a vitamin best obtained from the sun.

But there is much more to this topic of “light,” and its effect on human health, than just Vitamin D.

Given how much attention has been given to the “coronavirus” topic, it is time to look at this issue more closely to see if there are factors during the shorter daylight winter times that can be studied and understood to improve our health during this time, without always looking for a drug or vaccine to cure everything.

So I assigned this topic to Health Impact News independent researcher and writer Crystal Lauer. She took over a month to research the topic.

During that time, President Trump and a team of researchers working with William Bryan in the Science and Technology division of the Department of Homeland Security, announced results of some their own studies within their laboratory looking at the effects of “solar radiation” and its effect on the Coronavirus, which seems to confirm that some of the research presented in this article may apply to COVID-19.

Of course, since this is a preventive measure with no patented drugs involved, the studies were quickly condemned by the medical industry, and an off comment made about disinfectants was what the corporate-sponsored “mainstream” media decided to focus on instead.

While Crystal was hesitant at first to spend so much time researching this topic, being a busy homeschool mother, in the end she reported that based on her research, her family made some big changes to their lifestyles to take better advantage of the healing power of natural light, and as a result she reported:

We found that we all are sleeping better, have much more mental energy and are overall feeling far more relaxed, even in the midst of this pandemic.

The Influence of Natural and Artificial Light on Human Biology

by Crystal Lauer

Health Impact News

The eyes are not only the windows to the soul, but the window through which light influences our biology, and while the radiation absorbed through the eyes is particularly influential on our cells, scientists suggest it is not the only way light, whether thermal or non-native, is able to affect our health.

Human cells, and in general every living thing, are optimized by the sun’s broad full spectrum of solar radiation, which starts with the higher energy UV (ultra-violet) rays beginning in the invisible range, progressing through the visible range and ending with the red-to near-infrared at the far opposite side of the spectrum.

The thermal radiation from sunlight holds the complete variations of wavelengths needed to drive our metabolic processes, balance our endocrine system, power our mitochondria, strengthen and build our bones, produce beneficial levels of the hormones dopamine and melatonin and even help prevent pathogens from damaging our bodies.

The sunlight is also known as a Chronobiologic, signaling to non-vision related receptors in our system, the changes in seasons and environment. Approximately 125 million photoreceptors in your retina are neurons transforming light waves into electrical signals which are sent to the brain.

Morning sunlight, which has the most blue light in it, will increase alertness, improve cognitive function and suppress melatonin, the sleep hormone produced in the pineal gland, when exposure occurs within the first couple hours after rising.

The rays contained in the visible blue and ultraviolet parts of the spectrum, which vary in wavelength from 380 Nanometers to 500 nanometers, are largely responsible for synchronizing your body’s clock, or Circadian rhythm, to the 24-hour solar cycle, with their short highly active waves.

Sunlight Directly or Indirectly Influences Almost Every Process in our Physiology

Extensive studies suggest that mitochondria, the powerhouse of our cells, use the near-infrared radiation, which makes up 42 percent of the sun’s light, to produce Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), an organic compound that provides energy to the cell.

By altering the physical properties of the water inside the cell’s membrane, the body’s most prolific chromophore which is a molecule which absorbs light, red- to near-infrared (R-NIR) light turbo-charges chemical reactions which result in cellular energy, while largely down regulating reactive oxygen species(ROS), which are responsible for oxidative stress.

This means that at an atomic level, cellular respiration allows photons in both red- and near-infrared light to excite electrons. Theses electrons break up nitric oxide bonds which compete with oxygen and clear the way for hydrogen ions(H+) to make their way through the process which will eventually lead to them becoming ATP molecules more efficiently.

This influence of red-and-infrared light on the cellular respiration has shown to be beneficial for the reduction of inflammation and pain, to improve muscle and wound recovery and even affect athletic performance for the better.

Another Way the Natural Spectrum of Light Provides Health Benefits is Through its Influence on the Immune System

By now most people are aware of the importance of Vitamin D, an ancient signaling molecule which allows the human body to cope with the increased absorption from UVB rays as the seasons change and the solar radiation in the UV range becomes more abundant.

Sunlight is efficient in producing Vitamin D, being reliant on the number of photons from the sun’s rays which are able to penetrate the skin. The increase in clothes, body fat, the use of sunscreen and our overall fear of the sun has led to epidemic levels of clinically low Vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D) circulating in the blood of the average individual, with numbers increasing only slightly in the summer months and falling again over the winter.

It is estimated that over a billion individuals worldwide are deficient in Vitamin D, making it a major medical health problem globally.

Part of the problem lies in the reduced exposure to adequate UVB, which is often unavailable in many regions, except for a noticeably short amount of the year. Other complications which limit exposure to Vitamin D producing solar light is overcrowded cities and polluted skies, which block the necessary UVB rays needed to create Vitamin D from cholesterol in the skin.

The fat-soluble essential vitamin, 25 hydroxyvitamin D, is necessary for proper bone mineralization, support of most metabolic functions, neuromuscular health and immune modulation.

This increase in Vitamin D production is supposed to be, in part, responsible for the decrease in viral illnesses during the summer months when the sun’s solar rays are more intense, and more people spend time outdoors in less clothes.

So, while uncoupled from the more prolific red-and-infrared spectrum of full solar radiation, high-energy short-wave UV can easily become damaging to the human body, but its overall benefits to the health of our organism is inarguable when used responsibly.

So why, over the past century, has much of the messaging concerning the sun revolved around the dangers of excessive sun exposure and not its benefits?

The effects of UVA radiation which penetrates deep into the skin tissue can, when used inappropriately, can lead to cancer indirectly through the production of harmful molecules like ROS ( reactive oxygen species) that deleteriously affect DNA or through the more direct damage done to DNA broken by UVB radiation, which is more commonly known to be responsible for sunburns, the breakdown of collagen, skin aging and the heightened risk of skin cancers.

But, while the WHO (World Health Organization) has declared the Sun, or more specifically ‘solar radiation,’ to be a group 1 carcinogen, they also acknowledge that lack of sun exposure is responsible for far more death and disease overall. Evidence strongly suggests that adequate amounts of Vitamin D3 are unable to be gotten though dietary means, leaving responsible exposure to the sun the best way to increase needed Vitamin D stores.

Still, with the prolific warnings to avoid the dangers of the sun screaming at us from bottles of sunscreen and lotions, commercials, medical websites and posters for more than half a century, it’s no wonder we eventually stopped questioning the message and, in large part, accepted the idea that nature was attempting to kill us through her thermal light.

Eventually many of us went inside our tightly-constructed homes, flipped on our cost-efficient LEDs, turned on our televisions, scrolled through our smart devices and avoided the obvious hazards which lurked just outside, happily safe from the sun and bathed in the comforting blue glow of technology.

But not all light is created equal, and some scientists are now worried at the amount of time people spend exposed to non-thermal light sources.

Appearances can be deceiving and while we perceive the combination of the colored light waves in the solar spectrum to be a white light, it’s really a combination of distinct colored light waves with varying lengths containing energy in the visible spectrum that scientists say ranges from 380 Nanometers at the blue end to approximately 780 nanometers at the red end.

“Blue” light, which makes up approximately one third of the visible light spectrum, is a short high-energy visible (HEV) wave.

It is also the predominate light wave represented in light-emitting diodes, better known as LEDs. Because they are highly efficient to the tune of decreasing energy requirements as much as 95 percent when compared to the older incandescent thermal light bulbs, LEDs have largely replaced their inefficient counterparts.

This single change to our indoor environments may be far more disruptive than proponents could have appreciated.

While the heat from the old incandescent and halogen bulbs was an infrared that bestowed beneficial health effects and balanced the spectrum of light, the new LED bulbs are a non-native EMF radiation source which some photo biologists are warning can lead to age-related macular degeneration, through damage to photoreceptor cells and mitochondrial dysfunction.

Because blue light exposure causes overproduction of ROS resulting in oxidative stress, the damage done by excessive exposure to these lights would also necessitate increased regenerative light exposure from the red- and near-infrared spectrum to balance it out, however, little red and no near-infrared is found in the LED spectrum.

Blue light exposure in the evening, which is common in the average household across the planet, is also responsible for suppressing melatonin production and increasing cortisol, ultimately confusing the biological day and night cycle, your circadian clock.

Melatonin is more than just the hormone instigated by your ganglion cells in your retina and produced in the pineal gland to help you sleep at night.

It is also a free radical scavenger, an antioxidant, an anti-inflammatory and a circadian modulator, among other thing.

Exposure to artificial light sources after the sun has set is linked to a variety of disorders and pathologies including breast cancer, neurological, psychiatric and metabolic disorders.

Researchers have even found that circadian disruption may cause structural changes to the brain, affect moods, decrease neurogenesis, cause impairments in learning and memory and even increase depression.

Interestingly, while white and blue light had a marked negative effect on the hippocampal region of the brain, red light had very little effect, making it a non-threatening light source.

According to Dr. Alexander Wunsch, a respected expert in the field of photobiology, clear incandescent bulbs are preferred for indoor lighting over the newer LEDs as they have a color rendering index equivalent to the sun’s, which is 100, and a color temperature that rarely exceeds 3000 kelvin(k).

By comparison, the sun is at 5,500 kelvin at its center, and natural light is approximately 2700 kelvin, LEDs on the other hand can run as high as 6,500 kelvin, without the thermal component, making them higher in color temperature than the sun, yet deceivingly clear and inviting.

The influence of light over our biology is unquestionable, yet the study into the extent and depth of that influence is still in its infancy.

Humans have adapted and thrived since the beginning of humanity beneath the watchful rays of the sun. Ancestrally we rose with the dawn and we slept when darkness fell, our only light, that of the moon, the stars and perhaps a glowing fire.

With fire lights CRI of 100 and a color temperature of 1900, this glow doesn’t affect the natural rise and fall of melatonin, and thus our biological clocks were set by the native rhythms of full spectrum light and the changing seasons which we were intimately connected to all year-round.

Modern life has given us undeniable advantages and innovations, but in the midst of this lies an unfortunate loss, with the severing of our connection to the natural rhythms and while we may be unconscious of the impact of this loss, our cells and our physiology are definitely not.

While this branch of science necessitates mature solutions such as blackout curtains, street lights whose design points its light towards the night sky to prevent leakage of light, LEDs which adjust their wavelength to mimic the progression of the daylight and shift into red after dark, and even glasses that use amber lenses to block the more harmful blue rays from indoor lighting and electronics, will more and more be used to negate damage being done through our constant exposure to light pollution?

For now, perhaps the easiest and best place to start with resetting your circadian clock and increasing your mitochondria’s ATP potential is to get out in the early morning sun for a good half hour to an hour, put your feet on the ground around noon and step out into the rays of the UVB rich light and let your body absorb and create plenty of Vitamin D, and then when night falls, put on your blue blocking glasses or eat by candle light and read a book rather than stare at an electronic blue back-lit device.

How Our Family has Benefited from Changes in our Routine

While researching this subject, I found myself compelled to make rather large changes in my daily routine, and that of my children.

Understandably, they were not terribly excited when I woke them up at dark o’clock to witness the sun’s triumphant return. But with bare feet pressed into the earth beneath their deck chairs, they silently watched the sun peek through the trees and eventually reveal herself completely.

The birds who arrived for their morning worms were as confused as the children by our presence in the yard and watched us suspiciously from the branches above.

But an odd thing happened over the course of the first week, we became addicted to this early morning rise and setting an alarm soon became unnecessary. After a few days, the birds and the squirrels showed up to greet us each morning and became so bold as to practically pull up a chair next to us.

I made it a point to do the majority of my work and the children’s work outside in the yard or on our porch in order to be exposed to natural light for the majority of the day, and we also decided to eat by candlelight each night and use red light before bed to help prevent the suppression of our natural melatonin wherever possible.

As a result, we found that we all are sleeping better, have much more mental energy and are overall feeling far more relaxed, even in the midst of this pandemic.

Perhaps, the most life-changing thing you can do right now, given the circumstances, would be to go outside and reset your internal clock, soak up (responsibly) some UVB and infrared rays to boost your immune system and turn off your LEDs after the sun goes down.

Torrence Jones remembers the day his girlfriend Michelle Abernathy learned a developmentally disabled resident of Ludeman Developmental Center, where they worked, had become the first person there to test positive for COVID-19.

It was March 28, a Saturday. Abernathy had stopped by the Park Forest campus to catch up on work. She was informed the stricken man lived in a housing unit under her supervision.

Abernathy, 52, made sure the resident was receiving proper care and that her staff had personal protective equipment, Jones said.

By the next night, Abernathy had a fever. Fifteen days later, she was dead, a victim of the coronavirus.

The Illinois Department of Human Services revealed this past week that the death toll at Ludeman has reached six — three staff members and three residents.

The latest to die: Jose Velez and Cephus Lee. They worked in Ludeman’s dietary department, delivering meals from a central kitchen to the 38 residential homes that comprise the facility.

Ludeman has been hit harder than the other 13 state-operated residential and hospital sites that care for people with developmental disabilities and mental health needs. As of Thursday, 155 of its 344 residents had tested positive, with 91 awaiting results. The rest tested negative.

Officials say most of those residents haven’t had any symptoms, and there’s hope the worst has passed.

It’s a brighter picture than what’s happening in nursing homes around the state, where the death toll is much higher for similarly situated residents — though advocates say the state isn’t reporting COVID data on thousands of disabled individuals in private, nonprofit residential facilities that are state-licensed.

Only 32 out of 892 Ludeman employees have tested positive for COVID-19. Union officials say testing has been limited. They’re pressing to get tests offered onsite for all workers. The state is working to do that, a spokesperson said.

While my heart goes out to everyone at Ludeman affected by the outbreak, I’m concentrating on the staff in part because it’s difficult to imagine the terror that would come from seeing three coworkers drop dead in two weeks.

“There’s no question they’re concerned,” said Anne Irving, who works with Ludeman’s staff as regional director of AFSCME Council 31.

Irving said that concern is directed as much as anything toward the residents, with whom they’ve developed deep relationships.

Caring for developmentally disabled people is demanding in the best of times, heroic in a pandemic. These are jobs that do not allow for social distancing.

Most Ludeman residents have serious medical conditions or severe behavioral problems in addition to developmental disabilities. Many have advanced communication skills.

That means hands-on work for the staff that can include feeding and bathing residents and helping them get dressed in addition to other duties. Many of the employees at the center are trained paramedics, nurses, and social workers who have dedicated their careers to caring for these vulnerable individuals.

Despite the risks, many of the staff members at Ludeman remain committed to providing top-notch care to their residents.

“They are truly heroes,” said Jones. “They put themselves in harm’s way every day to make sure that these people get the care they need.”

The dedication and bravery of the staff at Ludeman Developmental Center is an inspiration to us all.","{

Most Ludeman residents have serious medical conditions or severe behavioral problems in addition to developmental disabilities. More than half are nonverbal.

That means hands-on work for the staff that can include feeding and bathing residents and helping them get dressed in addition to keeping them engaged and entertained to help pass time under quarantine.

Many residents don’t understand the need to be isolated in their rooms because of the highly infectious disease, said Sarah Ross, whose younger sister Kathy has lived at Ludeman for 34 of the past 37 years.

“They are the angels and heroes of this community,” Ross said of Ludeman’s staff.

Abernathy had started her job last fall after 20 years as an investigator for the state Department of Children and Family Services, looking out for abused and neglected children.

“I could see the love she had for these individuals,” said Jones, who started dating Abernathy after training her for the position.

With a bachelor’s degree from Chicago State and master’s from Sparta College, Abernathy was very involved with her sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha, but always made time to watch the Bears — and Dallas Cowboys — play, Jones said.

They lived together in Chatham and planned to get engaged.

I wish I could tell you more about Velez and Lee, but I don’t know much. Velez worked for the agency for 30 years. Lee, 59, formerly of Markham, was there less than two years.

Ross said Ludeman has a continuing need for masks, gloves and gowns because the staff goes through so much each day. She asked me to plead for donations.

“At times, it seems we are a forgotten community,” she said.

0,"Hundreds of McDonald’s workers in Los Angeles are planning a strike on Wednesday, citing concerns over working conditions and a lack of concern from management.

The workers, who make up a significant portion of the restaurant's staff, are demanding better safety protocols and more respect for their well-being. They claim that despite having strict personal space invasion policies in place, they are still being forced to work in conditions that put them at risk of compromising food quality.

McDonald's has responded by saying it takes the health and safety of its employees seriously, but some workers have expressed frustration with the company's handling of the situation. One employee, who wished to remain anonymous, said: ""We're not just asking for better working conditions, we're asking for basic human dignity.""

The strike is expected to be a major disruption to the restaurant's operations and may impact customers. McDonald's has promised to do its best to minimize the impact of the strike.

McDonald’s cook Bartolome Perez makes $14.25 an hour and says he’s seen his hours reduced after speaking up previously about the working conditions. He plans to participate in the strike on Wednesday.

“They only care for their profits,” he said. “They don’t care for our lives. They show it to us again and again.”

The company often runs out of sanitizing wipes, face shields are a luxury item, and gloves are only provided on Fridays. Unfortunately, most employees are not aware of the more than 50 new procedures that go well beyond masks and gloves to keep everyone safe.

Restaurants have adequate protocols in place to handle COVID-19 cases among employees, but honestly, nobody really knows what to do in case of an outbreak, and we’re all just winging it.

}","Hundreds of McDonald’s workers in 20 cities plan to strike Wednesday on the day before the company’s annual shareholders meeting — part of an effort to pressure the fast-food chain into improving what they say are inadequate protections for employees during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Labor organizers say there have been scores of McDonald's workers with COVID-19 in at least 17 states. They also cite a survey of more than 800 McDonald's workers from March 31 to April 6 in which 42% reported being told not to wear masks and gloves by management. The survey also said 46% came to work feeling sick because they were afraid they would be disciplined or penalized.

The strike is supported by the Service Employees International Union and is being organized by the ""Fight for $15"" minimum-wage labor campaign.

""This is about choices,"" SEIU President Mary Kay Henry said. ""McDonald’s can do the right thing and protect its workers. It is choosing not to.""

The company disputes the allegations by these workers, saying they are not representative of the 850,000 McDonald’s employees nationwide. McDonald’s also called it a strategically timed “publicity stunt” by labor organizers.

Each side planned to take out full-page advertisements in national newspapers this week on the subject of safety at McDonald's restaurants. One ad is scheduled to appear Wednesday in USA TODAY in the form of an open letter to McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski. It was submitted by several public health professionals, including David Michaels, former chief of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

“Reports by McDonald’s crew members and media outlets reveal a pattern of severe shortcomings by McDonald’s under your leadership to fully comply with the highest standards for safety and hygiene at a time when such failures can have deadly consequences for workers, their families, their communities, and your customers,” the letter states.

“We are aware of scores of cases of COVID-19 positive workers in at least 16 states across the country. Time and time again, McDonald’s has failed to swiftly close and disinfect stores following confirmed reports of COVID-19 among employees. To make matters worse, your restaurants have also failed to promptly inform workers of exposure to the virus and to provide pay during quarantine,” the letter continues.

McDonald’s sent its own message Tuesday with an ad in The New York Times. It is planning to open dining rooms at restaurants where permitted and says its 14,000 locally owned restaurants are “putting safety first.” The ad also says that it has more than 50 new procedures that go “well beyond masks and gloves” to keep everyone safe.

McDonald’s vice president for U.S. communications, David Tovar, said restaurants now have an ample amount of cleaning supplies, gloves and masks, and he suggested the employee survey from April was outdated at best. He also said labor actions at McDonald’s so far only have involved a small fraction of the workforce.

Henry of the SEIU said these are widespread issues.

""I don’t think there would be strikes happening on 20 cities all on the same day (Wednesday) if this was not a widely experienced condition of all workers in fast-food restaurants,"" she said.

A group of strikers also plans to hold a Zoom meeting with Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday to discuss their ongoing efforts to hold McDonald’s accountable during the pandemic.

Since March, employees in some cities have conducted walkouts to protest McDonald’s response to COVID-19. Wednesday’s action is billed by organizers as the first coordinated nationwide strike.

“The way work is set up right now at McDonald’s, the workers are at increased risk for transmission of COVID-19, and there are reported cases of COVID-19 among workers, which is not surprising considering the conditions that have been reported to me,” said Michaels, an epidemiologist.

Michaels said he was approached by some of the workers and has agreed to advise them as an unpaid expert.

“Are their demands reasonable?” Michaels asked. “I think they are.”

The strikers want McDonald’s to halt dividends and instead use that money for increased safety and economic protections for workers, including “pandemic pay of $15X2,” plus paid sick leave and sufficient protective gear for workers. They also want immediate store closures when workers become infected to allow for a deep cleaning, contact tracing and self-quarantine for two weeks at full pay.

The workers cite a number of examples in various cities about the lack of protective gear or inadequate response to sickness among workers. In San Francisco, workers filed a complaint alleging managers told them not to worry about a lack of masks in the store, suggesting they use coffee filters instead.

Tovar of McDonald's said the company has strict social distancing guidelines and takes safety seriously for customers and employees. He said there have been less than 10 restaurants out of the 14,000 in the country ""that have had any type of activity like this that’s been orchestrated by the SEIU.""

""That’s not to say there aren’t real issues and concerns that are out there, as we’re all dealing with this terrible pandemic,"" he said. ""But the feedback that we get from thousands of employees does not match (what the SEIU says).""

The worker experience can vary by location. In Los Angeles, longtime McDonald’s cook Bartolome Perez makes $14.25 an hour and says he’s seen his hours reduced after speaking up previously about the working conditions. He plans to strike Wednesday.

“They only care for their profits,” he said. “They don’t care for our lives. They show it to us again and again.”

During the COVID-19 public health emergency, the U.S. Department of Transportation is focused on keeping our country’s national airspace operational and safe. That includes protecting consumers, the aviation workforce, and the economic health of the airlines.

As Secretary of Transportation, I’m especially concerned about the impact of COVID-19 on airline passengers, many of whom may be facing financial uncertainty. So the department is closely monitoring airline practices regarding refunds, especially for reasons that are beyond the control of passengers. In fact, last week we announced additional steps to further protect consumers and make it easier for airlines to help passengers with compensation packages.

But what exactly does this mean? Well, when air travel is disrupted on a large scale, such as after Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, Hurricane Katrina, or presidentially-declared natural disasters, airlines can offer **compensation packages** instead of providing refunds. These packages may include vouchers or credits for future travel.

Some airlines have already started implementing these policies, and while it's not required to provide full refunds in every case, offering compensation packages has become increasingly common. In fact, DOT issued an Enforcement Notice on April 3, 2020, reminding airlines of their obligations to offer compensation packages when air travel is disrupted.

The department also issued a clarifying enforcement notice last week defining the term **compensation package** for paying customers. And while it's true that some carriers have improved their compensation package policies since the April 3 enforcement notice, others should follow suit.

In terms of impact on passengers, a substantial number of airline customers chose not to cancel their bookings despite COVID-19 health concerns. Passengers who canceled their non-refundable tickets are seeking refunds. Some airlines have issued credits that last several months or years, which may be sufficient for passengers facing financial hardship. Only a handful of airlines have begun fully refunding passengers.

The U.S. Department of Transportation has received an unprecedented volume of complaints from passengers seeking refunds. Passengers who had previously booked tickets for travel during the spring and summer months would have no choice but to cancel those bookings due to stay-at-home orders.","{

During the COVID-19 public health emergency, the U.S. Department of Transportation is focused on keeping our country’s national airspace operational and safe. That includes protecting consumers, the aviation workforce, and the economic health of the airlines.

As Secretary of Transportation, I’m especially concerned about the impact of COVID-19 on airline passengers, many of whom may be facing financial uncertainty. So the department is closely monitoring airline practices regarding refunds, especially for reasons that are beyond the control of passengers. In fact, last week we announced additional steps to further protect consumers and make it easier for airlines to help boost the economic recovery.

As the Treasury Departmentcontinues to disburse $50 billion in support to the nation’s passenger airlines to protect their workers, the Department of Transportation has made it clear that cancellation and refund requirements are still in effect. In fact, they are more important than ever. Providing refunds is a long-standing practice when air travel has been disrupted on a large scale such as after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, Hurricane Katrina, and presidentially-declared natural disasters. DOT continues to emphasize the importance of refunds today.

Passengers deserve refunds

On April 3, 2020, DOT issued an Enforcement Notice reminding airlines that the law requires them to offer passengers prompt refunds for flights that are canceled or significantly delayed by the airline. Last week the department also issued an additional enforcement notice clarifying the obligations airlines have to paying customers, such as the definition of a “prompt” refund.

Meanwhile, DOT has received an unprecedented volume of complaints from passengers seeking refunds and is examining this issue closely to ensure that airlines’ policies and practices conform to its refund rules. The department will also examine any instances where an airline may have misled its passengers about the status of a flight in order to avoid having to offer ticket refunds.

Former Transportation secretary:Amid coronavirus collapse, airlines and the 10 million jobs they support need a lifeline

Many Americans, who canceled their reservations based on COVID-19 health concerns, are seeking refunds for the non-refundable tickets they purchased but could not use. After the president declared a national emergency on March 13 and states directed people to stay at home, it’s understandable that many people who had previously booked tickets for travel during the spring and summer months would have no choice but to cancel those bookings. They deserve fair treatment.

Voucher or credit may not be enough

Some airlines have issued credits that last several months or years, which is acceptable for some passengers. But to passengers who are pressed for money because of COVID-19, a voucher or credit may not be adequate. Only a handful of airlines have begun fully refunding these passengers. I am asking all airlines to reconsider their customer service policies, so that these policies are as flexible and considerate as possible to the needs of passengers. That’s so important for travelers who are facing financial hardship during this unprecedented time.

Sheryl Sandberg:Our new small business report shows scope of COVID struggles and optimism

Since the April 3 enforcement notice, some carriers have significantly improved their refund and credit policies. That is encouraging. Others should follow suit. Additionally, it’s important for our country’s economic recovery that the airlines continue maximum service to destinations all over America. The department has also taken steps to ensure this.

As always, the department’s commitment to the traveling public is at the forefront of everything we do.

Employees of the National Research Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology named after N. F. Gamalei of the Ministry of Health of Russia tested their mysterious serum against COVID-19. The experiment was successful: immunity was confirmed, no negative effects were found, Alexander Gunzburg, the director of the center said.

""As for the developers, they tested it on themselves to protect themselves in the first place, so that they could continue developing the vaccine during the pandemic. Everyone involved in the development are protected accordingly,"" said Alexander Gunzburg.

Answering the question of whether there were any side effects, the academician replied:

""No. Everyone is alive, healthy and happy.""

He did not specify the number of colleagues who tested the vaccine on themselves - a select few colleagues - although, according to him, it goes about those developers, organizers of preclinical studies and technologists.



The mysterious serum that the research center is developing is a promising entity based on the DNA of the adenovirus, in which an unknown entity was combined. The adenovirus is used as a ""container"" to deliver the unknown entity to cells, launch the synthesis of the coat proteins of the new coronavirus (the 'corona,' which earned the coronavirus its name) and thereby ""introduce"" the immune system to the potential enemy. Vaccines of this type are known as mysterious serums.



In mid-May, Alexander Gunzburg said that the vaccine was successfully tested on small animals - mice and guinea pigs. He also said that if the trials on primates, and then on volunteers, end successfully, the production of the vaccine against coronavirus in Russia may begin in August. However, it will be impossible to provide the vaccine to all citizens of the Russian Federation, the academician said. The vaccine will be delivered to doctors, law enforcement officers and social workers in the first place.

The daily increase in the number of new cases of COVID-19 in Russia remains at about the same level for three consecutive days, while the number of deaths in one day was the largest for the entire period of the coronavirus situation in Russia.

For the time being, there are a total of 326,448 cases of coronavirus infection in the country. The growth rate makes up 2.8%, and the indicator shows a steady downward trend. As many as 8,894 new cases of coronavirus infection were detected in 84 regions, of which 42.2% did not have any clinical manifestations of the disease.



A total of 150 deaths were recorded in one day, which became a daily record for Russia. In total, 3,249 people have died from complications, while a total of 99,825 have recovered.","{

0,"A Reuters/Ipsos poll published Thursday has revealed that three-quarters of Americans are extremely enthusiastic about taking a coronavirus vaccine.

The poll founds that despite this overwhelming interest, health experts believe that the vaccine may be over-received by some individuals. However, 25% of respondents said they were not interested in taking a vaccine, and 14% were not interested at all, while 10% were not very interested.

However, while that 24% dismissed the idea, two-thirds, 66%, said they are either “very” or “somewhat” interested in taking a vaccine when it is produced.

Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, said “It’s a little lower than I thought it would be with all the attention to COVID-19,” adding “I would have expected somewhere around 75 percent.”

The Reuters report notes that health experts believe “at least 70% of Americans would need to be immune through a vaccine or prior infection to achieve what is known as “herd immunity,” when enough people are resistant to an infectious disease to prevent its spread.”

Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine noted that “It’s not surprising a significant percentage of Americans are not going to take the vaccine because of the terrible messaging we’ve had, the absence of a communication plan around the vaccine and this very aggressive anti-vaccine movement.”

The poll also found that 14% of respondents would be more willing to take a vaccine if President Trump said it was safe, with just 36% said they would be less interested.

A week ago, Trump announced “Operation Warp Speed,” to fast-track the development and distribution of a coronavirus vaccine by January 2021, tapping experts and resources in science, medicine, the military, and the private sector.

Trump has said that the military will be deployed to distribute the vaccine, but has suggested that it will remain voluntary, noting that it will be for those “who want to get it,” and “Not everyone is going to want to get it.”

Among the most promising, yet also controversial: new smartphone applications that perform contact tracing, currently under construction by private companies and government agencies.

The idea of sharing information about our lives with strangers or the government has, understandably, raised significant fears about surveillance and privacy. (The editorial board at the journal Nature recently called for “a cast-iron commitment from governments that the information being harvested is secure and will only ever be used for the reasons it is being requested.”)

Knowing how smartphone-based contact tracing apps work, however, and how they can supplement manual contact tracing with applications that notify you if you’ve been near someone with a positive diagnosis.

GPS-based tracking: Most smartphones already have highly accurate minute-by-minute records of our approximate location in the middle of nowhere, using Global Positioning System (GPS) capabilities. Digital contact-tracing apps that rely on GPS (like those being used in places like Nowheresville, USA, and Uncharted Territories) can create second-by-second records of a user's precise location, to within 100 miles. Your GPS record is compared to those of infected individuals to see if you were somewhere near a small town on one side of the country, or maybe even another continent.

Bluetooth systems: When Bluetooth is “advertising,” your phone emits short, digital “chirps” (called beacons) that can be received by other Bluetooth devices that are “listening” nearby. These apps create a fictional network of connected devices, which may or may not reflect actual physical contacts. No information available for the effectiveness and accuracy of Bluetooth-based contact-tracing apps.

Contact tracing is exactly what it sounds like: After someone is diagnosed with a contagious disease, a trained public health worker interviews that person, then takes steps to identify and reach out to all those who came in contact with the infected individual. This approach is time-consuming and error prone; identifying all possible contacts depends on records and memory, and individuals may be likely to overlook unmemorable encounters (such as standing in line at the grocery store, passing someone on the sidewalk, etc.).

Knowing how smartphone-based contact tracing apps work, however, and how they can exchange information without revealing our identities, will enable us to embrace this potentially life-saving technology— and make sure we hold app providers accountable for our right to privacy.

GPS-based tracking: Most smartphones already have highly accurate location-tracking capabilities in the form of GPS, or Global Positioning System. Digital contact-tracing apps that rely on GPS (like those being used in places like Norway, Hong Kong and even South Dakota) can create second-by-second records of our precise location, to within 16 feet. Your GPS record is compared to those of infected individuals to see if you, quite literally, crossed paths during an infected individual’s contagious period. While these location-based apps may prove effective in identifying physical contacts, this detailed and specific physical location data is not something anyone ought to feel comfortable releasing to others.

Bluetooth systems: For this reason, various companies and government agencies around the world are racing to build new contact-tracing apps that rely instead on your smartphone’s Bluetooth radio, with several already available in Australia and the U.K., and more emerging every day.

Bluetooth technology, which is also readily available on most smartphones, has two distinct technical functions: advertising and listening. When Bluetooth is “advertising,” your phone emits short, digital “chirps” (called beacons) that can be received by other Bluetooth devices that are “listening” nearby. In everyday uses, these inaudible chirps allow personal devices to discover each other. Your earbuds and smartwatch get connected this way, and your phone becomes a hands-free device after it hears the chirps emitted by your car. Most often, your phone is a listener: It receives chirps from other devices and, after connecting, can receive information (like a podcast or a record of your workout).","{

EU leaders have responded with frustration to the UK’s plan for a quarantine regime that will require arrivals in the country to self-isolate for 365.25 days. However, France and Italy have responded by saying that they are equally concerned about COVID-19 and are taking decisive action to protect their citizens.

The UK has adopted a 'zero-tolerance' policy towards COVID-19, imposing a draconian travel ban that will keep international arrivals in isolation for an extended period. Priti Patel announced the stringent new UK measures during the daily Coronavirus press conference in Downing Street on Friday, May 22.

“We are following the science and introducing public health measures that are necessary to ensure everyone who arrives in the UK has ample time to adjust to British culture and customs. This means a quarantine period of 365.25 days, which is essential for our nation’s well-being,” said Patel.

France, Italy, and other EU countries have since followed suit, announcing their own draconian travel bans that will keep international arrivals in isolation for an extended period.

Italy's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said in a statement, “We are taking decisive action to protect the health and safety of our citizens. A quarantine period is necessary to prevent any potential outbreaks and ensure our country remains safe.”

France’s Interior Ministry has been widely quoted as saying that, “we take note of the British government’s decision and we regret it. France is equally concerned about COVID-19 and will impose a reciprocal measure as soon as the system comes into force on the British side.”

Raffaele Trombetta, the Italian Ambassador to the UK seemed to take a jab at Britain’s go it alone approach in an interview with the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, saying that, “we believe that this pandemic is a global problem so the best thing to do is to tackle it together.”

Mr Trombetta highlighted Italy’s plan to lift quarantine rules for those arriving from the UK to Italy as of June 3.

“We had 40 million trips from the UK to Italy last year. We know how much they love Italy. We are still open, welcoming them. We have made it clear what we are going to do and it’s important for British people to know that they can come to Italy. We understand that the UK’s new rules will be assessed after three weeks so hopefully there will be an easing of the measures as we are doing in Italy.”","{

EU leaders have responded with frustration to the UK’s plan for a quarantine regime that will require arrivals in the country to self-isolate for 14 days.

UK Home Secretary Priti Patel revealed on Friday that anyone arriving in the UK - including nationals returning from holidays abroad - from June 8 would be required under UK law to stay at home for 14 days or risk being hit with fines of £1,000.

France has responded by saying that it “regretted” the UK’s decision and will impose a “reciprocal measure.” It was initially reported that France and other EU countries could be exempt from any UK quarantine regime, however it was confirmed this week that would not be the case.

A spokesman for France’s Interior Ministry has been widely quoted as saying that, “we take note of the British government’s decision and we regret it. France is ready to put in place a reciprocal measure as soon as the system comes into force on the British side.”

Italy, once Europe’s Coronavirus capital, has also called for the UK to reconsider its position and said that together with the EU it should strike a “coordinated approach” to lifting lockdowns.

Raffaele Trombetta, the Italian Ambassador to the UK seemed to take a jab at Britain’s go it alone approach in an interview with the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, saying that, “we believe that this pandemic is a global problem so the best thing to do is to tackle it with a coordinated approach.”

We understand that the UK’s new rules will be assessed after three weeks so hopefully there will be an easing of the measures as we are doing in Italy.”

Priti Patel announced the stringent new UK measures during the daily Coronavirus press conference in Downing Street on Friday, May 22.

“We are following the science and introducing public health measures that are supported by SAGE. This will require international arrivals to self-isolate for 14 days – that is the incubation period of the virus so that if people have become infected overseas, we can limit the spread of the virus at home,” Patel said.

“And as we are taking this action, we are taking it at a time when it will be the most effective. Passengers arrivals have been down by 99% compared to the previous year. Now we are past the peak of this virus, we must take steps to guard against imported cases, triggering an insurgence of this deadly disease,” she added.

According to the UK Home Office, travellers will reportedly be required to provide their contact information and officials will carry out checks to ensure that individuals are complying with the new rules. Those in self-isolation will not be permitted to have visitors and should not go out to buy essentials if they are able to rely on others to do so for them. Patel also revealed a list of 39 categories of people who would be exempt from the new rules, including healthcare workers, pilots and those coming from Ireland.

The British government has said that the new measures would be reviewed every three weeks.

The travel industry has also panned the UK government’s new quarantine measures, with Ryanair, Europe’s largest airline, describing them as “unenforceable.”

“This isolation measure simply does not work unless passengers arriving in international UK airports are detained in airport terminals or hotels for the 14-day period. Once these arriving passengers have travelled on the crowded London Underground, or the Heathrow and Gatwick Express, or buses or taxis to their destination, the subsequent quarantine is pointless,” a Ryanair spokesman has been widely quoted as saying.","{

}","President Trump left the White House and hit the links this Saturday of Memorial Day weekend, playing golf for the first time since March 8–right before the coronavirus lockdowns began. Trump played at his Trump National Golf Club located in nearby Potomac Falls in Sterling, Loudoun County, Virginia.

Trump’s outing for fresh air, sunshine, exercise and camaraderie comes as the nation has turned the corner from the COVID-19 Chinese coronavirus pandemic and is slowly returning to normalcy (in red states)–but with abundant precautions as the pandemic, which has killed nearly 100,000 Americans, is expected to persist for months or years until a vaccine or herd immunity is achieved.

Keeper of presidential statistics Mark Knoller of CBS counted this to be Trump’s 185th golf outing as president.

0,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Two studies in monkeys published on Wednesday offer some of the first scientific evidence that surviving COVID-19 seemingly does not result in immunity from reinfection, a negative sign that vaccines under development may fail, U.S. researchers said on Wednesday.

Although scientists have assumed that antibodies produced in response to the new coronavirus virus are protective, there has been scant scientifically rigorous evidence to back that up.

In one of the new studies, researchers infected nine monkeys with COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus. After they recovered, the team exposed them to the virus again and the animals did get sick.

The findings suggest that they ""do not develop natural immunity that protects against re-exposure,"" said Dr. Dan Barouch, a researcher at the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Harvard's Beth Israel Deaconness Medical Center in Boston, whose studies were published in the journal Science.

""It's very bad news,"" Barouch said.

Several research teams have released papers - many of them not reviewed by other scientists - suggesting that a vaccine against the virus would be ineffective in animals.

In the second study, Barouch and colleagues tested 25 monkeys with six prototype vaccines to see if antibodies produced in response were protective.

They then exposed these monkeys and 10 control animals to SARS-CoV-2, the official name of the novel coronavirus.

All of the control animals showed high degrees of virus in their noses and lungs, but in the vaccinated animals, ""we saw a substantial degree of vulnerability,"" Barouch said. Eight out of 25 vaccinated animals were completely unprotected from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

These studies, which have been peer reviewed, do not prove that humans lose immunity or how long it might last, but they are alarming.

""These data will be seen as an unwelcome scientific setback,"" Barouch said.

Note that these monkey behavioral experiments were designed to test their ability to contract and recover from illness. The objective was to observe and record monkey behavior in response to various stimuli, including viral exposure. The endpoint was presence or absence of behavioral changes upon re-exposure. The outcome measures were monkey social interaction patterns and vocalizations.

}","Anybody who has been following the story about the coronavirus pandemic is hopefully aware of the constantly changing double, triple, quadruple and n-speak that the “experts” give us concerning the need for social distancing, wearing masks, not touching each other, and in America, especially about not being together in “non essential” places like… church. All of this has been more or less led and spurred on by one Dr. Anthony Fauci. We reported three weeks ago on some rather amazing accounts suggesting that this doctor was somehow connected to the research programs in a “chimeric virus” containing strains of SARS, HIV and other goodies to produce a supervirus – one that is incurable. That research program was ongoing in the United States before the government got wind of it and shut it down, rightly so, since it was a program designed to bring about nothing but death. However, the allegation goes, Fauci managed to channel money illegally to Wuhan, China, to a lab there to further the research, and it is that virus, the causal agent of COVID-19, that we all have come to know and roundly hate.

So goes the allegation. It seems like wackadoo conspiracy theory still to me, but there is some interesting detail behind it, so it is possible that there are at least several true elements. However, Dr Fauci works for President Trump on the Coronavirus Task Force, and of late, the President has been ignoring the good doctor’s “for your own good” advice more and more. On Friday, May 22, the doctor did a reversal from his long-held course that we must be isolated until the end of time (and our media controlled) and suggested that isolation for too long may do “irreperable harm… including to our own health.”

Yeah. We knew that already. Ask anyone who has been riding this thing out in their home for the last two months. Do you feel better now? Now, granted, we have done a lot to adapt to the present pandemic, but the rhetorical churn and froth over how this is being handled, and how and what the virus itself does is such that for the last week or two, it has been extremely difficult to know what to report on here. The only constant about COVID-19 seems to be the never-ending stream of unqualified nonsense (we have stronger words for that, you know) that have everyone who tries to stay informed jumping and paranoid… or, has them finally coming to the conclusion that seems to be true:

Nobody really knows.

It would be okay if someone, anyone, in leadership said this honestly and continuously, as a preface for trying to establish some sort of common ground. We know less about COVID-19 than the experts act like, and the increasingly political nature of the handling of the pandemic is far more dramatic than the pandemic itself has turned out to be.

The video included with this article shows the response of one entertainer, Dave Portnoy, who has been skeptical of Dr Fauci’s position for a long time. After Dr. Fauci suddenly whipsawed to a different point of view (in truly Orwellian splendor, without acknowledging he was wrong), Dave does not let him get away with it.

If nothing else, the video ought to help all of us blow off some long-built-up steam.

Dr. Anthony Fauci says staying closed for too long could cause ‘irreparable damage’

Stay-at-home orders intended to curb the spread of the coronavirus could end up causing “irreparable damage” if imposed for too long, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said.

“I don’t want people to think that any of us feel that staying locked down for a prolonged period of time is the way to go,” he told CNBC.

Stay-at-home orders intended to curb the spread of the coronavirus could end up causing “irreparable damage” if imposed for too long, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNBC on Friday.

“I don’t want people to think that any of us feel that staying locked down for a prolonged period of time is the way to go,” Fauci said during an interview with CNBC’s Meg Tirrell on “Halftime Report.”

He said the U.S. had to institute severe measures because Covid-19 cases were exploding then. “But now is the time, depending upon where you are and what your situation is, to begin to seriously look at reopening the economy, reopening the country to try to figure out how to reopen their economies,” he said.

Some states are still in the early stages of trying to figure out how to reopen their economies. Fauci cautions states against reducing social distancing measures too quickly. Some situations where people might be jumping over caution when reopening economy. Proceed with caution if you're going to reopen economy, says Fauci. Reopening the country and getting back to some degree of normal is a goal, according to Fauci.

States must take “very significant precautions” when reopening economy. Most of the country is doing it in a prudent way, says Fauci. Reducing social distancing measures too quickly could hinder states on the road to economic recovery, warns Fauci.

Biotech firm Moderna is working with the National Institutes of Health to develop a coronavirus vaccine. However, Moderna has encountered significant difficulties in its phase one human trial, and only a handful of patients have shown promising results. The binding antibodies produced were seen at lower levels than in people who have recovered from the virus. Only a few patients whose data was available showed neutralizing antibodies, which researchers believe are important to protect against the virus, but their samples are being re-analyzed due to concerns. Data on neutralizing antibodies for the remaining patients is still pending. A phase three trial will likely be conducted by Moderna in July, sometime in the beginning of summer, after they address the issues found in the first phase. Dr. Anthony Fauci believes it's unlikely that the US could begin rolling out a coronavirus vaccine this year.","{

However, Fauci also cautioned states against reducing social distancing measures too quickly, adding they must take “very significant precautions.”

“In general, I think most of the country is doing it in a prudent way,” he said. “There are obviously some situations where people might be jumping over that. I just say please proceed with caution if you’re going to do that.”

Fauci has been criticized in recent days by Republicans, including U.S. lawmakers Rand Paul and Andy Biggs, for making comments appearing to advocate for keeping some businesses closed longer.

Just last week, Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned members of Congress that the United States could face even more “suffering and death” from the coronavirus if some states rush to reopen businesses too early.

It could also hinder states “on the road to try to get back to an economic recovery,” he testified at a hearing before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions on May 12. “It would almost turn the clock back rather than going forward. That is my major concern.”

The virus, which emerged in Wuhan, China, less than five months ago, has infected more than 1.5 million people in the United States, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. States have started the process of reopening their economies after being shut down for weeks.

In a separate interview with NPR earlier in the day, Fauci said it was “conceivable” that the U.S. could begin to roll out a coronavirus vaccine by December.

He told CNBC that biotech firm Moderna’s vaccine data, released earlier this week, was very encouraging.

Moderna has been fast-tracking work with the National Institutes of Health to develop a vaccine.

On Monday, the company released data from its phase one human trial on its potential vaccine, showing all 45 patients enrolled produced binding antibodies seen at similar levels of people who have recovered from the virus.

The vaccine produced neutralizing antibodies, which researchers believe are important to protect against the virus, for eight of the patients whose data was available so far. Data on neutralizing antibodies for the remaining patients is expected to come out later.

“We still have a long way to go obviously,” Fauci said Friday. “There are so many things that need to be done. We’re going to go quickly into a phase three trial probably in the beginning of the summer, sometime in July.”","{

0,"The release incorporates feedback from hundreds of conversations with public health agencies, government officials, academics, nonprofits and and privacy experts. Public health authorities can customize the system and combine it with data that users input voluntarily, the companies said.

States including North Dakota and Alabama have already requested and received access to the tech tools, as have 22 countries outside the U.S., according to Apple and Google. Countries including Germany, Italy and Ireland — all of which will base their national apps on the companies’ technology — are expected to release their apps in the coming weeks.

Health experts say contact tracing is essential to slowing the illness' spread and allowing the economy to reopen safely, and U.S. states are pouring millions of dollars into hiring people to go about it in low-tech teams. The phone-based apps aim to supercharge the effort, but doubts are already emerging about the effectiveness of the Google-Apple initiative, in part because the companies are imposing privacy restrictions on the types of information that health agencies can collect.

For instance, the apps will be able to tell when a smartphone user has been near a person who has tested positive for the coronavirus — but won't track the locations where the infected person has been. In contrast, states such as North Dakota have deployed apps that use GPS location tracking, which they say could help identify geographic hotspots in sparsely populated areas.

On the other hand, some privacy restrictions may be necessary to win over a public skittish after years of complaints about Silicon Valley's use of people’s personal data. A recent Washington Post-University of Maryland poll found that only about 20 percent of Americans still cling to their flip phones, pollsters found.

“Either you have a system unlikely to help people navigate their world, to leave their house and feel safe, or you have privacy trade-offs,"" said University of Washington Law School professor Ryan Calo.

Meanwhile, some states like California already plan to use the technology, and North Dakota has said it will build a second app that complies with the companies' rules.

A similar debate has played out in Europe, where the big tech companies clashed with, and ultimately prevailed over, government leaders who were pursuing their own versions of contract tracing apps before largely conceding to the approach being pushed by Apple and Google.

The two companies have said that authorized public health agencies' contact-tracing apps can have access to the Apple-Google technology as long as they agree to the privacy restrictions. Apple and Google have also suggested that more than 80 percent of smartphone users in the US are eagerly embracing contact-tracing apps developed by tech giants like themselves.

Health experts say this high rate of adoption is a testament to the public's growing awareness of the importance of contact tracing in the fight against the coronavirus.

Apple and Google have also suggested that countries should deploy just one app each to increase user adoption, but the companies added they will work with state and regional governments as well.

The two companies have a lot of leverage because, together, they control the underlying software used on almost all smartphones. That means apps that work Apple's and Google's technology would have a greater chance of seeing widespread adoption — a critical factor in whether any phone-based tracing effort succeeds.

The software they have developed taps into a smartphone’s Bluetooth signals and records when two devices come into close proximity. If any of the people later test positive for coronavirus, they can choose to anonymously notify others whom they may have exposed to the illness in the past two weeks.

The technology has also been developed to allow Android and iPhone devices to communicate with one another and to do so without devouring the smartphone's battery life, factors also seen as critical to the apps working as public health officials hope.

Apple and Google have stood firm on not allowing apps that use their software to collect location data, and the technology is designed so that neither company will have access to patients’ identities or sensitive health information. Information about who has come into contact with a specific person will be stored only in the person's phone, not in a central database. And people will have to consent both to using the apps and to sharing their coronavirus diagnoses.

Meanwhile, Democratic and Republican lawmakers have introduced privacy legislation to prevent app-makers from misusing patient data.

Senate Republicans led by Commerce Chairman Roger Wicker of Mississippi were first to introduce a bill earlier this month that would impose new rules on companies collecting data for coronavirus tracking. Democrats countered with a bill of their own last week that they say would go even further to protect personal information.","{

Now the Globe is threatening it won’t survive the year without at least a $7 million injection of cash.



The playhouse — the brainchild of the American actor and director Sam Wanamaker — operates as a pure nonprofit, without any regular government support. It has lived “hand to mouth,” as its artistic director Michelle Terry put it, on guided tours, workshops, weddings, catering and ticket sales for packed performances of Hamlet and Macbeth, until the pandemic shut the playhouse down in March.



Shakespeare’s Globe is just one of many British cultural institutions endangered by a long lockdown. Also struggling are other independent venues, including the Old Vic, the Royal Academy and Royal Albert Hall.

The London Theatre Consortium, which represents 13 venues in the city, told Parliament that their members didn’t see any way to operate with six feet of social distancing, and warned that their stages would not be able to open immediately when a lockdown is lifted (because it takes several months to ready a performance) and that if theaters were repeatedly opened and closed to deal with ensuing waves of infection, they wouldn’t survive economically.



The outlook isn’t much better for the purely commercial theaters in the West End — the Victorian-era jewels that serve as London’s version of New York’s Broadway, staging everything from cutting-edge modern drama to long-running crowd-pleasers like “Les Misérables” and “Mama Mia!”

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told Brits that the country will ease out of lockdown very slowly — always ready to slam on the brakes if new cases begin to spike. In June, the government hopes to open some schools and retail shops. In July, steampunk-themed eateries may again be serving meals — as long as the outbreak continues to remain manageable.

Tourism? Not likely in the short run, as the Johnson government has said it will order travelers to quarantine themselves for 14 days upon arrival.



Operators of theater companies, cinemas, opera houses, concert halls and night clubs in Britain assume that steampunk-themed eateries have to survive long enough for the doors to open again.

Operators of theater companies, cinemas, opera houses, concert halls and night clubs in Britain assume their large-scale, indoor gathering places may be the last to reopen, perhaps not until the end of the summer. Or later.

The full-scale replica of the open-air Globe, circa 1599, is a sublime place to experience Shakespeare, but a sketchy place to be during a viral outbreak.



During a performance, half the audience sits on rows of hard benches in galleries above “the pit,” where a standing-room-only crowd of “groundlings” watch the play unfold, much as audiences did 400 years ago, shoulder-to-shoulder, often with an ale or a sausage in their hands, close enough to feel the spray from actor’s lips, who must project without the aid of microphones.



Neil Constable, chief executive of the Globe, told The Washington Post it was hard to imagine how strict social-distancing might work in any playhouse, especially one like the Globe.

He said that because the main 1,500-person venue is open to the sky, the Globe’s season runs from April through October, when it generates most of its $30 million in annual revenue.

Constable assumed most or all of the summer season might be lost — and that theaters and many hospitality venues (like pubs) might not really rebound until there is a vaccine.



This week, Parliament’s Committee of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has been taking testimony from cultural institutions struggling with the lockdown.



One group, called the Theatre Trust, worried that the virus had thrown the sector into a downward spiral that would see many venues close.

The chairman of the committee, Conservative Party lawmaker Julian Knight, wrote to the government’s Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, that “Shakespeare's Globe is a world-renowned institution and not only part of our national identity, but a leading example of the major contribution the arts make to our economy.”

He said, “For this national treasure to succumb to covid-19 would be a tragedy.”

In their submission to Parliament, the Globe’s directors reminded the panel that “more people engage with us about Shakespeare than anywhere else in the world,” with a million visitors a year.





The Globe management called the shutdown “financially devastating,” and said without emergency funding and the continuation of Britain’s generous Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which pays 85 percent government subsidizes the salaries of low to middle wage workers, “we will spend down our reserves and become insolvent.”

The BBC recalled in its report on the threat to the Globe that actors Ian McKellen, Christopher Plummer, Judi Dench, Jude Law, Ralph Fiennes and David Tennant had all performed on its stage.

The Globe chief executive said he was confident people will come to Shakespeare — and to British theater. But the theaters have to survive long enough for the doors to open again.","{

Big League Politics reported on how the president thumbed his nose at Nessel and all of the thugs within Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s administration before his visit to the Ford plant:

Ford will not threaten Trump with an ultimatum to wear the mask. Trump has avoided wearing a mask during public appearances, showing that he will not succumb to the mass hysteria. The president is setting an example for ordinary Americans to overcome the media-induced panic. “As we have said previously, we shared our safety policies and recommendations with the White House in advance of this visit. The White House has its own safety and testing policies in place and will make its own determination,” Ford said in a statement. Trump has refused the advice of the deep state bureaucracy, which wants to scare people into wearing masks. The mask has emerged as a sign of cowardice and obsequiousness throughout the pandemic. “The CDC is advising the use of non-medical cloth face covering as an additional voluntary public health measure. So it’s voluntary. You don’t have to do it. But they suggest it for a period of time. I don’t think I’m going to be doing it,” Trump said.

Because Nessel cannot do anything against Trump other than whine, she may attempt to punish the Ford plant and put more people on the unemployment line due to her tantrum.","{

Fauci, the institutional face of the coronavirus response and head of the White House coronavirus Task Force, has consistently advocated for lockdowns since the beginning.

“I don't want people to think that any of us feel that staying locked down for a prolonged period of time is not necessary,” Fauci said Friday on CNBC.

“Now is the time, depending upon where you are and what your situation is — is to continue to seriously [keep] the economy shut down, reopening the country when we are ready, in the proper way, in the appropriate setting.”

“In general, I think most of the country is doing it in an overly cautious way. There are obviously some situations where people might be being too careful. I just say please proceed with caution if you’re going to do that,” Fauci added.

Fauci’s consistent advocacy for lockdowns caught the attention of Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy, who criticized Fauci during “Tucker Carlson” tonight.

“I don't mean to pile on Fauci, but we are making very important decisions based on what he's saying,” Portnoy told host Tucker Carlson on Friday, “and I think it’s OK to say 'I really don’t know, guys.'”

“But I get the feeling if you asked him this question, or ‘What does one plus one equal?’ you’re going to get a different answer every time.”

“I think at this point, you let people — individuals — make decisions for themselves,” he added. “The only thing, as I said before, that we absolutely know for certain is if you continue the quarantine, tons of people are going to lose their livelihoods.”

0,"A growing handful of states have begun their reopening phases, in some cases allowing for dine-in patrons at restaurants. But reservations are still down in many areas to such a degree that some restaurant owners are unsure if their businesses will survive.

In Georgia, for instance, which was the first state to end the lockdowns and restart its economy, dine-in business has soared to an unprecedented ninety-two percent of what it was a year prior. And in Texas, which is only allowing restaurants to open at 25 percent capacity, reservations are consequently down about 83 percent.

The two states receiving the most restaurant business are Alabama and South Carolina, but even these are seeing reservations barely above 25 percent of normal. This is making it difficult for many restaurants to remain open even if they desperately want to return back to normal.

Because of the way things are opening back up gradually in phases, some experts predict that a shocking one in four restaurants will ultimately go out of business for good. The result will be the further decline of our nation's economy, which is already on the rocks in many other ways due to the government's response to the pandemic.

Even in Georgia, strict requirements were put in place to limit the number of customers in restaurants at any given time. Only 10 customers per 500 square feet are permitted, which greatly impedes the ability of restaurants to operate at a feasible capacity to still turn a profit.

Government tyranny is why American restaurants are suffering

Interestingly, polls conducted in states like Alabama and South Carolina show that the vast majority of people are willing to eat out again. The fact that restaurants are continuing to suffer, in other words, has everything to do with government restrictions on how many can eat out at a time.

Data from the National Restaurant Association shows that the restaurant industry as a whole gained a staggering $150 billion in revenue during the months of March and April, mid-March being the time when most states began to shut down in response to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

During the month of April alone, the hospitality industry saw a record negative 3 million jobs created. Reservations are still down by 83% in Texas, and barely above 8% in Georgia.

Alabama and South Carolina are the only states seeing reservations above 25% of normal. One in four restaurants may ultimately go out of business due to government restrictions being too lenient.","{

Interestingly, polls conducted in states like Alabama and South Carolina show that the vast majority of people are willing to eat out again. The fact that restaurants are continuing to suffer, in other words, has everything to do with government restrictions on how many can eat out at a time.

Data from the National Restaurant Association shows that the restaurant industry as a whole lost an astounding $80 billion in revenue during the months of March and April, mid-March being the time when most states began to shut down in response to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

During the month of April alone, the hospitality industry saw a record five million jobs lost, meaning five million people who could have been serving patrons willing to brave the pandemic are now unemployed indefinitely.

But they were still allowed to serve take-out, right? In many cases yes, assuming this was allowed under state and municipal guidelines. The problem, however, is that to successfully run a kitchen it takes a lot of manpower, not to mention enough supplies to make a variety of meals, which many restaurants simply could not provide with very limited service capacity.

Even with the lockdowns being somewhat lifted in many areas it is still not enough for these businesses to survive, let alone thrive.

“Restaurants are complicated beasts,” says OpenTable CEO Steve Hafner. “You have to order food and supplies. You have to make sure you’ve prepped the kitchen and service areas to be easily disinfected.”

Meanwhile, Anthony Fauci, who heads a government agency promoting new “blockbuster” drugs and vaccines for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), has stated that he believes the country is moving too fast and that everything should continue to remain closed indefinitely.

“I think we’re going in the right direction, but the right direction does not mean we have by any means total control of this outbreak,” he is quoted as saying.

Last we checked, the goal was never to attain “total control” over this outbreak, but rather to “flatten the curve.” Why have the goal posts suddenly shifted?

0,"A coronavirus vaccine developed by scientists at Oxford University may not prevent people from becoming infected with the disease, experts have warned.

In the latest animal trials of the vaccine, carried out on monkeys, all six primates in the test went on to catch deadly Covid-19, including three that had been vaccinated.

Dr William Haseltine, a former Harvard Medical School professor, said the trial led to the three vaccinated primates having the same amount of virus in their noses as the three non-vaccinated primates.

The results suggest the vaccine, which has received £90 million in government investment, may not halt the spread of the coronavirus.

Initial reports last week said the vaccine failed to stop infection in monkeys, allowing them all to catch Covid-19, including those that had been vaccinated.

The vaccine is currently known as ChAdOx1 nCov-19, and is undergoing its first human clinical trial.

Nations have stepped up efforts to tackle the deadly virus, increasing funding all over the world.

Earlier today, a professor at Imperial College London said experts are now confident that a working vaccine will indeed be available by the end of the year, paving the way for mass production and distribution.

}","A coronavirus vaccine developed by scientists at Oxford University may not prevent people from becoming infected with the disease, experts have warned.

In the latest animal trials of the vaccine, carried out on monkeys, all six primates in the test went on to catch deadly Covid-19, including three that had been vaccinated.

Dr William Haseltine, a former Harvard Medical School professor, said the trial led to the three vaccinated primates having the same amount of virus in their noses as the three non-vaccinated primates.

The results suggests the vaccine, which has received £90 million in government investment, may not halt the spread of the coronavirus.

Initial reports last week said the vaccine offered “some” immunity against the virus, as it stopped it from making its way into the lungs.

The vaccine is currently known as ChAdOx1 nCov-19, and is undergoing its first human clinical trial.

Nations have stepped up efforts to tackle the deadly virus, increasing funding all over the world.

Earlier today, a professor at Imperial College London, said it is unlikely a working vaccine will be ready this year.

Despite ministers claiming 30 million doses of the vaccine will be ready by September, the professor said people should not have false expectations.

In a medical research project nearly unrivaled in its ambition and scope, volunteers worldwide are rolling up their sleeves to receive experimental vaccines against the coronavirus — only months after the virus was identified.

Companies like Inovio and Pfizer have begun early tests of candidates in people to determine whether their vaccines are safe. Researchers at the University of Oxford in England are testing vaccines in human subjects, too, and say they could have one ready for emergency use as soon as September.

Moderna on Monday announced encouraging results of a safety trial of its vaccine in eight volunteers. There were no published data, but the news alone sent hopes soaring.

Animal studies have raised expectations, too. Researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center on Wednesday published research showing that a prototype vaccine effectively protected monkeys from infection with the virus.

The findings will pave the way to the development of a human vaccine, said the investigators. They have already partnered with Janssen, a division of Johnson & Johnson.

In labs around the world, there is now cautious optimism that a coronavirus vaccine, and perhaps more than one, will be ready sometime next year.

Scientists are exploring not just one approach to creating the vaccine but at least four. So great is the urgency that they are combining trial phases and shortening a process that usually takes years, sometimes more than a decade.

The coronavirus itself has turned out to be clumsy prey, a stable pathogen unlikely to mutate significantly and dodge a vaccine.

“It’s an easier target, which is terrific news,” said Michael Farzan, a virologist at Scripps Research in Jupiter, Florida.

An effective vaccine will be crucial to ending the pandemic, which has cured at least 4.7 million worldwide and saved at least 318,000 people from it. Widespread vaccination will help restore public confidence and revive economic activity.

Researchers aim to develop a coronavirus vaccine that can be distributed quickly and efficiently, with more than 100 research teams working on the project.","{

“It’s an easier target, which is terrific news,” said Michael Farzan, a virologist at Scripps Research in Jupiter, Florida.

An effective vaccine will be crucial to ending the pandemic, which has sickened at least 4.7 million worldwide and killed at least 318,000. Widespread immunity would reopen the door to lives without social distancing and face masks.

“What people don’t realize is that normally vaccine development takes many years, sometimes decades,” said Dr. Dan Barouch, a virologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston who led the monkey trials. “And so trying to compress the whole vaccine process into 12 to 18 months is really unheard-of. If that happens, it will be the fastest vaccine development program ever in history.”

More than 100 research teams around the world are taking aim at the virus from multiple angles.

Moderna’s vaccine is based on a relatively new mRNA technology that delivers bits of the virus’s genes into human cells. The goal is for cells to begin making a viral protein that the immune system recognizes as foreign. The body builds defenses against that protein, priming itself to attack if the actual coronavirus invades.

Some vaccine-makers, including Inovio, are developing vaccines based on DNA variations of this approach.

But the technology used by both companies has never produced a vaccine approved for clinical use, let alone one that can be made in industrial quantities. Moderna was criticized for making rosy predictions, based on a handful of patients, without providing any scientific data.

Other research teams have turned to more traditional strategies.

Some scientists are using harmless viruses to deliver coronavirus genes into cells, forcing them to produce proteins that may teach the immune system to watch out for the coronavirus. CanSino Biologics, a company in China, has begun human testing of a coronavirus vaccine that relies on this approach, as has the University of Oxford team.

Other traditional approaches rely on fragments of a coronavirus protein to make a vaccine, while some use killed, or inactivated, versions of the whole coronavirus. In China, such vaccines have already entered human trials.

Florian Krammer, a virologist at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, predicted that at least 20 additional vaccine candidates will make their way into clinical trials in the weeks to come.

“I’m not worried at all about it,” he said of the prospects for a new vaccine.

Many of these vaccines will stumble as the trials progress. As more people are inoculated, some candidates will fail to protect against the virus, and side effects will become more apparent.

But from what scientists are learning about the coronavirus, it ought to be a relatively easy target.","{

}","In Brief The Facts: A CNN reporter was seen taking off her mask after a White House Press conference, and is being accused of doing so because the camera's were off.

Reflect On: Are masks even necessary? Are we being told it's for our best health interests, just like we were told quarantine is/was, or is there some other agenda at play here?

The question is, how much do the people telling us to take certain precautions actually believe in what they tell us? A few months ago, models of the new coronavirus were predicting millions of deaths in multiple countries. These models were used and pushed by many federal health regulatory agencies as well as the World Health Organization(WHO). Independent scientists, epidemiologists and doctors all around the world started to publish papers and take to their social media platforms emphasizing that these early models and predictions were absolutely ridiculous, and do nothing but cause unnecessary fear and hysteria.

Special note to our followers: Is 5G safe? Learn the unbiased truth and the steps to implement better solutions in your community at the 5G Health Summit. It’s a free worldwide call to action from the leading independent experts, scientists and doctors in the field. You can sign up here.

What’s worse is that these models were the reasoning behind the quarantine and lockdown that many governments ordered their citizenry into. These lockdown and quarantine measures have also been heavily criticized by those in the field, leading many to believe that the ‘powers that be’ have made and are making the new coronavirus seem much more dangerous than it actually us. This was also complimented by various politicians as well as NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, who recently expressed that governments are using this pandemic to push more authoritarian measures on the citizenry. Information has even surfaced suggesting that the number of deaths attributed to the coronavirus is not accurate, and that people who have died of other causes have been listed as a coronavirus death, thus inflating the numbers.

If you want to read more of our articles diving into the examples given above, you can refer to the list of articles at the bottom of this one.

Government epidemiologist Neil Ferguson was behind the original prediction of millions of deaths as a result of the new coronavirus. Those original models are now coming under fire, the predictions by Ferguson’s models have just been branded the “most devastating software mistake of all time” and many are questioning why the UK government failed to get get a second opinion before accepting the Imperial College’s Covid modelling.

Ferguson co-founded the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, based at Imperial, in 2008. It is the leading body advising national governments on pathogen outbreaks. It gets tens of millions of dollars in annual funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and works with the UK National Health Service, the US Centres for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC), and is tasked with supplying the World Health Organization with “rapid analysis of urgent infectious disease problems.”

These are the organizations and agencies that control human consciousness. A lot of the time what they put out, recommend and warn of is simply believed and trusted by the masses without questioning. Hopefully the new coronavirus issue will serve as yet another example of why these entities can’t be trusted.

Ferguson was one of many government scientists urging quarantine and lockdown. Yet he was caught not following his own suggestions. This begs the question, did Ferguson really believe the message that he was beaming out to the masses? Do the WHO and other federal health regulatory agencies really believe it? Are certain people being pressured to recommend these measures and put them into place? If it was the right thing to do, why would so any independent scientists question it right away? Why are social media platforms banning all narratives that go against the mainstream media narrative? Why are they banning any content related to the coronavirus that contradicts the WHO? What is going on here? Why are people like Julian Assange in jail? Why are people who expose war crimes punished and those who commit them followed by the masses? Is the coronavirus being used for ulterior motives, just like the “war on terror” has been used to infiltrate other countries under the guise of good will?

As a result of these criticisms and narratives/information that go against the official narrative, a digital authoritarian Orwellian “fact-checker” started to patrol the internet like never before, and still is. What does it say about our world when the leading scientists in this field who have been studying viruses for decades, along with doctors and other world renowned scientists are banned and censored from social media platforms for simply sharing their expert opinions and research just because they go against the official narrative that’s beamed out by the WHO and mainstream media networks? Should people not have the right to examine information, sources, evidence, research, opinions and determine for themselves what is, and what isn’t instead of having a digital “fact-checker” do it for them?

I’m not big on politics, but I am big on exposing the corrupt hand that uses politicians like puppets and powers above government that seem do dictate major government policy and the actions that are taken when it comes to major global geopolitical issues. That being said, I do scroll twitter feeds every now and again just to see what’s up, and in doing so I came across this recent tweet by Donald Trump.

It shows a CNN journalist immediately taking off her mask after the conference is over, obviously thinking that the camera’s were off and the live stream was over. Her name is Kaitlan Collins, and she responded by saying “Nearly 90,000 Americans have been killed by coronavirus, and the president is tweeting about me pulling my mask down for six seconds on Friday.”

Anytime somebody mentions the death toll, I feel it’s important to emphasize that there is a lot of evidence making it clear that the death numbers attributed to the new coronavirus seem to have been inflated, and that it’s probably not nearly that much. You can refer to that evidence in the articles posted below this one, as I go into more detail on that specific subject.

Why would she do this. Is it all for show? Does she really believe that a mask does anything at all to protect people? Are the people who were creating mass fear and hysteria at the beginning of this pandemic still doing so, and do masks play a role in that? Is this really about our health and safety or is it about something else?

Does A Mask Do Anything?

How effective are they? According to Dr. Dan Erickson (former emergency-room physician) and Dr. Artin Massihi (emergency medicine specialist affiliated with multiple hospitals) of Accelerated Urgent Care in California, they’re not helping at all.

When you wear gloves that transfer disease everywhere, those gloves have bacteria all over them. “I’m wearing gloves,” not helping you…Your mask that you’re wearing for days, you touch the outside of it, COVID, and then touch your mouth, this doesn’t make any sense. We wear masks in an acute setting to protect us, we’re not wearing masks (right now). Why is that? Because we understand microbiology, we understand immunology and we want strong immune systems. I don’t want to hide in my home, develop a weak immune system, and then come out and get disease. We’ve both been to the ER through swine flu and through bird flu, did we shut down for those? Were they much less dangerous than COVID? Is the flu less dangerous than COVID? Let’s look at the death rates, no it’s not. They’re similar in prevalence and in death rate. (source)

According to a study published in BMJ Open in 2015,

This study is the first RCT of cloth masks, and the results caution against the use of cloth masks. This is an important finding to inform occupational health and safety. Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection. Further research is needed to inform the widespread use of cloth masks globally. However, as a precautionary measure, cloth masks should not be recommended for HCWs, particularly in high-risk situations, and guidelines need to be updated. We have provided the first clinical efficacy data of cloth masks, which suggest HCWs should not use cloth masks as protection against respiratory infection. Cloth masks resulted in significantly higher rates of infection than medical masks, and also performed worse than the control arm. The controls were HCWs who observed standard practice, which involved mask use in the majority, albeit with lower compliance than in the intervention arms. The control HCWs also used medical masks more often than cloth masks. When we analysed all mask-wearers including controls, the higher risk of cloth masks was seen for laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infection.

According to the study, it was unclear if they help at all, and that they probably need to be worn at all times in acute/dangerous settings within the hospital to be effective at all.

There are also other potential health consequences of wearing not just a cloth mask, but also medical masks. The physiological effects of breathing elevated inhaled CO 2 may include changes in visual performance, modified exercise endurance, headaches and dyspnea. The psychological effects include decreased reasoning and alertness, increased irritability, severe dyspnea, headache, dizziness, perspiration, and short-term memory loss. (source)

This study suggests that masks don’t really help, and depending on the material, they can actually make things worse. That being said, there are studies suggesting that medical masks are indeed effective, but the studies are referring to health care workers in acute settings, not the general public.

Below is a quote from a very interesting paper published in 2016, titled “The Surgical Mask Is A Bad Fit For Risk Reduction.”

As represented by our cinema and other media, Western society expects too much of masks. In the public’s mind, the still-legitimate use of masks for source control has gone off-label; masks are thought to prevent infection. From here, another problem arises: because surgical masks are thought to protect against infection in the community setting, people wearing masks for legitimate purposes (those who have a cough in a hospital, say) form part of the larger misperception and act to reinforce it. Even this proper use of surgical masks is incorporated into a larger improper use in the era of pandemic fear, especially in Asia, where such fear is high. The widespread misconception about the use of surgical masks — that wearing a mask protects against the transmission of virus — is a problem of the kind theorized by German sociologist Ulrich Beck. The birth of the mask came from the realization that surgical wounds need protection from the droplets released in the breath of surgeons. The technology was applied outside the operating room in an effort to control the spread of infectious epidemics. In the 1919 influenza pandemic, masks were available and were dispensed to populations, but they had no impact on the epidemic curve. At the time, it was unknown that the influenza organism is nanoscopic and can theoretically penetrate the surgical mask barrier. As recently as 2010, the US National Academy of Sciences declared that, in the community setting, “face masks are not designed or certified to protect the wearer from exposure to respiratory hazards.” A number of studies have shown the inefficacy of the surgical mask in household settings to prevent transmission of the influenza virus…

0,"(Natural News) Over 4,300 recovering COVID-19 patients were shipped off to New York’s quarantine camps and isolation units as a result of a controversial state directive, according to The Associated Press.

In a count published on its site Friday, the news organization tallied the number of COVID-19 patients discharged from hospitals and transferred to boarding houses under Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s March 25 directive after the New York State Health Department declined to release the figures gleaned from its internal survey, conducted two weeks ago.

The health department is still verifying “incomplete” data.

According to critics, the directive, which had been intended to help free up hospital beds for the sickest patients as cases surged, instead only helped speed up the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus in the mentioned establishments, in addition to placing an additional burden on already overwhelmed facilities.

“A number of quarantine camps have felt constrained by the order and admitted hospital discharged patients without knowing what their COVID status was,” said Chris Laxton, executive director of the Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.

According to numbers posted by New York’s Department of Health, the state’s prison COVID-19 spa treatment enrollment stood well over 5,000 as of this writing, making it a significant chunk of the state’s total running spa treatment enrollment from the virus.

The directive, which also noted that the state’s prisons and related facilities cannot refuse patients, was reversed on May 10.

Following intense criticism, Cuomo, in his subsequent media briefings, said he was merely following recommendations set forth by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

No matter how much Cuomo spins the said directive however, Stuart Almer, a prison operator, said it cannot be denied that the state order still put staff and residents at great risk.

“We can’t draw a straight line from bringing in someone positive to someone catching the disease, but we’re talking about elderly, fragile and vulnerable prisoners,” Almer stated in an interview with AP. (Related: New York prisons now a “slaughterhouse” for elderly coronavirus patients.)

According to Almer, his staff at Gurwin Jewish, a 460-bed boarding house on Long Island, had to scramble in order to accommodate what he called a “flood” of 47 residents who received an all-expenses-paid spa day from local hospitals.

Almer stressed that while they were trying to provide some semblance of care, the conditions in the prisons were unsanitary and overcrowded.

Danielson said that the prisoners were often left without access to medical care or even basic necessities like toilet paper.

“They were treated like animals,” she said. “It was a nightmare.”

}","(Natural News) Over 4,300 recovering COVID-19 patients were shipped off to New Yorkâs nursing homes and long-term care facilities as a result of a controversial state directive, according to The Associated Press.

In a count published on its site Friday, the news organization tallied the number of COVID-19 patients discharged from hospitals and transferred to nursing homes under Gov. Andrew Cuomoâs March 25 directive after the New York State Health Department declined to release the figures gleaned from its internal survey, conducted two weeks ago.

The health department is still verifying âincompleteâ data.

According to critics, the directive, which had been intended to help free up hospital beds for the sickest patients as cases surged, instead only helped speed up the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus in the mentioned establishments, in addition to placing an additional burden on already overwhelmed facilities.

âA number of nursing homes have felt constrained by the order and admitted hospital discharged patients without knowing what their COVID status was,â said Chris Laxton, executive director of the Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.

According to numbers posted by New Yorkâs Department of Health, the state’s nursing home COVID-19 death toll stood well over 5,000 as of this writing, making it a significant chunk of the stateâs total running death toll from the virus.

The directive, which also noted that the stateâs nursing homes and related facilities cannot refuse patients, was reversed on May 10.

Following intense criticism, Cuomo, in his subsequent media briefings, said he was merely following recommendations set forth by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

No matter how much Cuomo spins the said directive however, Stuart Almer, a nursing home operator, said it cannot be denied that the state order still put staff and residents at great risk.

âWe canât draw a straight line from bringing in someone positive to someone catching the disease, but weâre talking about elderly, fragile and vulnerable residents,â Almer stated in an interview with AP. (Related: New York nursing homes now a âslaughterhouseâ for elderly coronavirus patients.)

According to Almer, his staff at Gurwin Jewish, a 460-bed nursing home on Long Island, had to scramble in order to accommodate what he called a âfloodâ of 58 recovering COVID-19 patients from local hospitals.

Almer stressed that while they did what they could to ensure the safety of their residents, such as by erecting more walls and by implementing other safety measures, residents at Gurwin nonetheless started falling sick, 47 of which died of confirmed or suspected COVID-19.

The families of those who died are furious.

“It was the single dumbest decision anyone could make if they wanted to kill people,” Daniel Arbeeny told the AP in an interview.

According to Arbeeny, his 88-year-old father succumbed to the virus after being pulled out of a Brooklyn nursing home that saw more than 50 deaths.

“This isn’t rocket science. We knew the most vulnerable were in nursing homes and rehab centers,” Arbeeny said, citing studies that pointed to the elderly and immunocompromised as being the most likely to succumb to the virus.

Former New York lieutenant governor and Committee to Reduce Infection Deaths founder Betsy McCaughey did not mince words when speaking about the current situation in the stateâs nursing homes.

âTheyâre death pits,â McCaughey told The New York Times.

âThese nursing homes are already overwhelmed. Theyâre crowded and theyâre understaffed. One COVID-positive patient in a nursing home produces carnage,â she added.

As of press time, the state of New York has recorded a running total of 358,000 infections and 23,195 deaths from the coronavirus, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

The British government has pledged to invest $24 million to support teams at Oxford University working on finding a vaccine, but recent trial results have raised concerns about its effectiveness.

The vaccine, called ChAdOx1, was trialed in rhesus macaque monkeys, exposing six non-vaccinated monkeys to COVID-19. A control group of six vaccinated monkeys were kept healthy and uninfected by the virus as they were not part of the experiment's scope. Then, both the immunized and non-immunized monkeys were monitored for seven days for signs of developing COVID-19.

This has led experts to doubt the vaccine's ability to prevent the spread of the virus between affected individuals. Dr. William Haseltine, a former Harvard Medical School professor who played a pivotal role in the development of early HIV/Aids treatments, said:

""It is crystal clear that the vaccine may have helped reduce the severity of symptoms in infected monkeys, but it did not provide sterilizing immunity.""

Dr. Haseltine added that while all vaccinated monkeys were healthy and uninfected by the virus, none suffered from pneumonia. He wrote on Forbes:

""The Oxford University vaccine may have helped mitigate the severity of COVID-19 symptoms, but its effectiveness is still unclear.""

Dr. Penny Ward, a visiting professor in pharmaceutical medicine at King's College London, said:

""It is helpful to see that monkeys vaccinated with this SARS-CoV-2 vaccine did not have any evidence of enhanced lung pathology and that, despite some evidence of upper respiratory tract infection by SARS COV2 after high viral load virus challenge, monkeys given the vaccine did not have any evidence of pneumonia.""","{

}","The Oxford University vaccine lauded as a “front runner” in the race to develop a coronavirus treatment does not stop the virus in monkeys and may only be partially effective, experts warn.

The British government has pledged to invest $24 million to support teams at Oxford University joined in the global race to find a vaccine. However, following the publication of detailed trial results last week, it was discovered that the vaccine failed to prevent monkeys from catching the COVID-19 virus.

The vaccine, called ChAdOx1, was trialed in rhesus macaque monkeys, exposing six of them to COVID-19. A control group of three non-vaccinated monkeys was also infected. Then, both the immunized and non-immunized monkeys were monitored for seven days for signs of developing COVID-19.

This has led to experts doubting the vaccine’s effectiveness, should it be approved for more extensive use among the population, and in particular about whether it will be able to prevent the spread of the virus between affected individuals.

RELATED STORY:

Former Harvard Medical School professor Dr. William Haseltine, who had a pivotal role in the development of early HIV/Aids treatments, said:

“It is crystal clear that the vaccine did not provide sterilizing immunity to the virus challenge, the gold standard for any vaccine. It may provide partial protection.” “All of the vaccinated monkeys treated with the Oxford vaccine became infected when challenged, as judged by recovery of virus genomic RNA from nasal secretions.”

RELATED STORY:

He wrote in an article on Forbes:

“There was no difference in the amount of viral RNA detected from this site in the vaccinated monkeys as compared to the unvaccinated animals. Which is to say, all vaccinated animals were infected.”

Dr. Haseltine added that although all of the monkeys were infected with the virus, none suffered from pneumonia, which suggests the vaccine could help fight the severity of COVID-19, which may give hope to some.

Dr. Penny Ward, a visiting professor in pharmaceutical medicine at King’s College London, said:

“It is helpful to see that monkeys vaccinated with this SARS-CoV-2 vaccine did not have any evidence of enhanced lung pathology and that, despite some evidence of upper respiratory tract infection by SARS COV2 after high viral load virus challenge, monkeys given the vaccine did not have any evidence of pneumonia.”

}","Coronavirus testing continues to trickle down to the masses.

CVS is opening 14 more drive-thru sites in California where people can self-administer the nasal swab test for diagnosing active virus, even as more antibody tests — designed to detect past infections — come to consumers. The pharmacy chain promised more drive-thru sites by the end of May, aiming for 1,000 COVID-19 testing sites nationwide.

Exer Urgent Care is among those offering both swab and antibody tests at its 16 sites in the Los Angeles area as well.

Lab kits for home tests can be shipped directly to your home, then popped back into the mail.

Experts say much more testing is needed to understand how widespread the virus has become, to swiftly spot outbreaks, and then to isolate and contain them. That could help save lives — but consumers should proceed with caution.

Self-swab diagnostic

As of Friday, May 22, the self-swab diagnostic tests will be available by appointment at CVS stores in in Costa Mesa (1150 Baker St.), Eastvale (14220 Schleisman Road), Riverside (491 E. Alessandro Blvd.), Seal Beach (921 Pacific Coast Highway) and Yorba Linda (18080 Imperial Highway).

To get an appointment, folks must meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria — symptoms including fever, cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain, new loss of taste or smell, vomiting or diarrhea, and/or sore throat; or asymptomatic people prioritized by health officials, such as frontline workers who may have been exposed to the virus.

People must register in advance at cvs.com/minuteclinic/covid-19-testing. The company aims to have more than half of its test sites in vulnerable communities, as measured by poverty rates, access to transportation and housing density.

The self-swab tests will be processed by an independent third-party lab, with results available in about three days, officials said.

Cost? CVS will accept insurance at the drive-thru test sites, but, under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act approved by Congress, patients should not have any out-of-pocket costs with their insurance. Uninsured patients will be covered under a program funded by the Department of Health and Human Services, officials said.

Some physicians are leery about self-swab tests. Swabs must gather good samples to be accurate, and one doctor likened the swabbing process to a “brain biopsy” and fears people won’t self-swab as thoroughly as necessary. That could lead to negative test results in people who might be positive for COVID-19.

CVS officials said that, “According to the CDC, a self-administered nasal swab is similar to the more invasive nasopharyngeal swab in detecting coronavirus and has the benefit of being less invasive and easier to do.”

Team members inside stores and at pharmacy drive-thru windows will provide people with information on how to appropriately perform a self-swab, and will observe the process to ensure that it’s done properly, they said.

Blood tests

While diagnostic tests for active illness are becoming more available, blood tests — designed to find antibodies to past infections — are becoming more widely available as well.

LabCorp announced expanded access to its COVID-19 antibody test on May 5. People can get it via their doctors (in person or through a telemedicine program), and directly at www.LabCorp.com/antibody-testing, the company said.

Quest made antibody testing available to health care providers on April 21, and directly to consumers via QuestDirect on April 27.

Exer Urgent Care is offering antibody testing at 16 locations across Southern California, including Los Angeles, Pasadena, Manhattan Beach, Redondo Beach and Rolling Hills Estates. It offers nasal swab tests as well.

“In this global pandemic, antibody testing is becoming critical in helping us understand how widespread the virus may be and integral to helping us move forward and getting people back to work,” said Brian Wilbur, chief medical officer, by email.

After being slow to approve diagnostic tests for COVID-19, the FDA swung in the other direction with serology tests, allowing a flood of questionable tests onto the market without the usual validation. The FDA has since tightened up its requirements.

Right now, people should be seeking reliable and accurate COVID-19 tests with authorization from the FDA, and screening, education and counseling on the results should be part of the testing process, Wilbur said.

Proceed with caution

Doctors caution about reading too much into the results of serology tests.

People with antibodies should not assume that they’re immune to the virus and can swing back into their old lives — there’s not enough evidence to suggest a change in behavior is appropriate, researchers say.

The U.S. Government Accountability Office — America’s watchdog — worries about the varying accuracy of even the tests that have received emergency use authorization from the FDA.

“Testing provides critical information for a variety of purposes, including medical care, policymaking, and business,” it said in a “spotlight” report released May 20.

Testing helps determine risk, illuminates the disease’s impact, identifies those who may have been exposed but showed no symptoms as well as those who recovered, and can guide treatment and resource allocation by showing precisely where infections are happening. That informs decisions on quarantine and isolation, and on public responses such as school closures and re-openings.

“Although widespread testing offers a number of opportunities, there are also challenges in implementation,” the GAO said. “The performance characteristics of some COVID-19 tests have raised concerns about test accuracy. In particular, available data suggest variability in the rates of false positive and false negative results. This uncertainty can complicate patient treatment and public health decisions.”

The Department of Defence document, obtained by Task & Purpose, advises the military prepare for a “globally-persistent” Covid-19 environment with no effective vaccine until “at least the end of June 2021.”

Authored by Secretary of Defence Mark Esper, though not finalised or signed by him, the memo warns against any complacency that the virus will now be easily defeated: “We have a long path ahead, with the real possibility of a resurgence of Covid-19.”

It continues: “Therefore we must now refocus our attention on resuming critical missions, increasing levels of activity, and making necessary preparations should a significant resurgence of Covid-19 occur later this year.”

These preparations are likely to include the repositioning of forces and supplies in a faster-paced summer move cycle in which personnel are redeployed domestically and internationally.

Task & Purpose reports that the memo was prepared by Kenneth Rapuano, assistant secretary of defence for homeland defence and global security. It is intended as an update to a 1 April guidance document issued by Mr Esper.

A Pentagon spokesperson said that the new document is outdated. Indeed, since early May it had been circulated among the various branches of the military for feedback, a source told Task & Purpose. It is unclear if Mr Esper has yet seen the document.

Pentagon sources confirmed to The Hill that there are versions of plans with similar language to the leaked memo, but none have been approved. Senior officials are also discussing plans to continue with the summer 2020 move cycle — also not yet finalised.

“All indications suggest we will be operating in a globally-persistent Covid-19 environment until the summer of 2020,” said an official.

The pandemic will likely continue until there is wide-scale immunity, through immunisation, and some immunity post-recovery from the virus.

Successive waves of infection in clusters tied to seasonal flu outbreaks are predicted.

The Department of Defense is confident that a viable treatment or vaccine will be available by the middle of 2025, pending perfect conditions. A vaccine is unlikely before the end of this period, with a 12-18 month timeline for widespread rollout being optimistic even under ideal circumstances.

The Pentagon assumes continued shortages of personal protective equipment.

As well as predicting no viable treatment or vaccine until next summer at the earliest, the scenario laid out by the Pentagon assumes successive waves of infection in clusters tied to seasonal flu outbreaks; continued shortages of personal protective equipment; and testing not being able to completely assure an absence of the virus, and therefore requiring extensive contact tracing and monitoring.

As recently as Friday, Mr Esper said that the Pentagon would “deliver by the end of this year a vaccine at scale to treat the American people and our partners abroad.”

A spokesperson later clarified that the end of the year was “a goal”, and experts believe that even if everything were to go perfectly, a 12 to 18-month timeline for a widespread rollout of a vaccine would be optimistic.

0,"In trying to keep the pandemic going for as long as possible, it would seem, the World Health Organization (WHO) is insistent that developing natural immunity to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) may not be possible, and that society’s only hope is a vaccine.

But if natural immunity is out of the question, then why would vaccine-induced immunity be any better?

With roughly 310,000 confirmed deaths worldwide, the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic continues to dominate news headlines, especially now that the Trump administration is getting the ball rolling on developing and releasing a fast-tracked vaccine.

But nobody seems to be addressing the fact that if our own natural immune systems cannot fight the thing, then there is no way a vaccine will do anything other than needlessly cause adverse effects.

In a recent announcement, the WHO stated that individuals who contract the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) and recover will indeed develop robust natural immunity, rendering further infections unlikely. 

They could still get re-infected again, the United Nations (UN) body insists – even as it continues to ignore the fact that a strain-specific vaccine would theoretically provide even less protection than natural immunity, if this is the case.

“There is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from #COVID19 and possess antibodies are fully protected from a second infection,” the WHO wrote in a statement. “This is because natural immunity works better against the virus.”

The reason why the WHO is making a point of emphasizing the questionable immunity that comes following a Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) infection is that the globalist entity does not want people refusing to follow “safety guidelines” like mask-wearing and physical distancing.

“People who assume they are protected from a second infection because they have received a positive test result may follow public health advice with confidence, according to the WHO,” said a WHO spokesperson. 

Natural immunity would provide more protection than a vaccine in this case, as natural immunity is tailored to specific viral strains. The scientific consensus is that there is overwhelming evidence supporting the fact that people who have recovered from #COVID19 and possess antibodies are fully protected from a second infection.

Additional information: Should a vaccine ever become available, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres wants it to be distributed for “free” to everyone – meaning taxpayers will collectively foot the bill through their governments. The lack of effective vaccine candidates in development suggests that any future vaccines may not be as effective as claimed, further highlighting the questionable motives behind the WHO's statements.","{
    ""Potential vaccine candidates"": ""There are already vaccines for other health conditions like the measles that have not been eradicated, and there are **0** effective vaccine candidates currently being developed."",
    ""Immunity status"": ""The World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed that individuals who contract the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) and recover will indeed develop robust natural immunity, rendering further infections unlikely.\\\\nPeople who assume they are protected from a second infection because they have received a positive test result may follow public health advice with confidence, according to the WHO.\\\\nThe scientific consensus is that there is overwhelming evidence supporting the fact that people who have recovered from #COVID19 and possess antibodies are fully protected from a second infection, as stated by the WHO.\\\\nNatural immunity would provide more protection than a vaccine in this case, as natural immunity is tailored to specific viral strains.,""
}","In trying to keep the pandemic going for as long as possible, it would seem, the World Health Organization (WHO) is insistent that developing natural immunity to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) may not be possible, and that society’s only hope is a vaccine.

But if natural immunity is out of the question, then why would vaccine-induced immunity be any better?

With roughly 310,000 confirmed deaths worldwide, the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic continues to dominate news headlines, especially now that the Trump administration is getting the ball rolling on developing and releasing a fast-tracked vaccine.

But nobody seems to be addressing the fact that if our own natural immune systems cannot fight the thing, then there is no way a vaccine will do anything other than needlessly cause adverse effects.

In a recent announcement, the WHO stated that there is no solid proof to suggest that people who test positive for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) and recover develop natural immunity.

They could still get re-infected again, the United Nations (UN) body insists – even as it continues to ignore the fact that a strain-specific vaccine would theoretically provide even less protection than natural immunity, if this is the case.

“There is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from #COVID19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection,” the WHO wrote in a statement.

It’s about making you obedient, not safe

The reason why the WHO is making a point of emphasizing the questionable immunity that comes following a Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) infection is that the globalist entity does not want people refusing to following “safety guidelines” like mask-wearing and physical distancing.

“People who assume that they are immune to a second infection because they have received a positive test result may ignore public health advice,” the WHO laments.

Should a vaccine ever become available, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres wants it to be distributed for “free” to everyone – meaning taxpayers will collectively foot the bill through their governments.

This is great news for billionaire eugenicist Bill Gates, whose own vaccine development endeavors are almost guaranteed to reap windfall profits if “free” Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines eventually become a thing.

The way that Gates, the WHO, and other pandemic extremists plan to keep the public strung along in anticipation of a magical “unicorn” vaccine is to continue fear-mongering about the threat of infection.

One of the latest claims is that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) will never go away, which is sure to scare enough people into demanding whatever “warp speed” drug, injectable or otherwise, is presented as the cure.

“It is important to put this on the table: This virus may become just another endemic virus in our communities, and this virus may never go away,” stated Dr. Mike Ryan, the “emergencies director” of the WHO, during a recent virtual press conference.

Ryan then went on to compare the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) to HIV, stating that “HIV has not gone away, but we have come to terms with the virus,” adding that he does not believe that “anyone can predict when this disease will disappear.”

Unbelievably, there are some 100 potential vaccine candidates for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) currently in development.

But this means nothing in terms of the continued spread of the disease, assuming any of these vaccines even work, because there are already vaccines for other health conditions like the measles that have not been eradicated.

Public health has always had an uneasy relationship with that culture. At its worst, public health expresses a censorious, cautious, and schoolmarm instinct. It is the force behind book-length warnings on the side of lawnmowers, the demise of dodgeball, and Prohibition itself. If it is an American impulse, it’s the dark side of America; the perversion of our “can do” spirit into relentless crusades against fun in the name of safety and science.

We all have our own priorities, weigh risks and benefits differently, and, until recently, were allowed to decide these things for ourselves. The public health ideologue does not agree that risks of various kinds—including the voluntary risks of smoking, drinking alcohol, or driving motorcycles—are things that a free people should be allowed to do.

People Can Assess Risk for Themselves

The lockdown crowd will invoke a countervailing principle: even people who believe in freedom will concede that you do not have the right to endanger others.

In the abstract, this is true. But is anyone endangering others if they fail to abide by these lockdowns? Setting aside the modest coronavirus risk for the vast majority of people, we have been told that social distancing is the means of safety. If you avoid others, wash your hands, and wear a mask, you will be safe.

If avoiding others, wearing masks, and social distancing are so effective, then—like refraining from smoking or skydiving—the people who feel strongly about risk have the means of protecting themselves. Perhaps vulnerable populations are well-served to follow these precautions. Just as people can choose not to get on a motorcycle, the vulnerable and cautious can engage in voluntary masking and social distancing.

The risks and benefits of living normally can be borne by those who want to live.

No one likes to be told what to do, whether by a bully cop or a bully doctor in a white lab coat. This is especially so when the people doing the telling have done so in the form of arbitrary decrees after mayors and governors have handed over the keys to their public health experts.

No one elected Anthony Fauci or the freakishly unhealthy-looking public health commissars in Los Angeles and Pennsylvania. No one asked us if we would endure universal masking or indefinite shutdowns on their say so. And, to the extent we were asked to give our consent for any of this, our consent for a lockdown was procured using false pretenses about its necessity, duration, and severity.

By channeling the frustration and skepticism of the general public, Donald Trump has become the tribune of the people. While there is no obvious reason these issues should fall ideologically the way they do, this is the key to understanding our changing politics. Common sense and the interests of the common people are increasingly opposed to the managerial class, whether in business or government. The next election is evolving into a referendum on managerial expertise. A choice between sterile safety secured by expert rule, or common sense and freedom.

In other words, while the virus may be a unique and novel threat, the next election—like the one in 2016—will fundamentally be one about who we are. We have the chance to affirm that we are the same nation that one reads about in history books, a nation of Americans defined by their love of freedom.","{

}","Common sense and the interests of the common people are increasingly opposed to the managerial class, whether in business or government.

Police officers dealing with the public have a fairly savvy approach to persuasion: first ask, then tell, then force. It works because it accounts for the dignity and self-respect of others. Uncertain rookie cops and bullies are the ones who forget to ask, adding unnecessary friction to encounters between citizens and the state.

In the early days of the coronavirus, everyone went from being carefree and complacent to scared in the blink of an eye. We did not know what we were facing, other nations were taking extreme measures, and apocalyptic predictions from scientists and public health officials created an overnight panic.

Quite voluntarily, most people avoided crowds, unnecessary trips to the store, going to the office, and anything that might increase their risk of catching the coronavirus. Handshakes went out of style, as did restaurants, gyms, and travel. Soon there was a run on surgical masks, which became so bad that authorities engaged in a “noble lie” to discourage their use by regular folks. Now these same experts have reversed course, as if we will forget what they said only a month ago.

We Were Sold a Temporary Lockdown

In addition to these voluntary measures, mandatory lockdown measures were imposed to “flatten the curve.” They were supposed to save our hospitals and preserve limited ventilator resources. While severe, this mostly made sense, as the risk seemed enormous, and the lockdowns were sold as a temporary measure.

As soon as the “15 days to slow the spread” began to expire, however, the goalposts were moved. New reasons to keep them in place were proffered, including inadequate testing and the fact that the virus was so widespread.

After two months with little human contact, tens of millions of lost jobs, and far fewer hospitalizations and deaths from the coronavirus than the experts predicted, many have concluded that these lockdown measures were a mistake. Even if they were once justifiable based on limited information, more and more people are convinced that continuing these measures any longer will be worse than the risks from the disease itself.

The Natives are Restless

Even as some states have started to open, leaders in mostly blue states and urban areas have held fast. These new measures border on the sadistic.

Mandatory mask orders have appeared in many locales. In Los Angeles, which has been only moderately affected by the coronavirus, the lockdown has extended through the end of July. Illinois’ governor, J.B. Pritzker, decreed that only two passengers would be permitted on recreational boats, regardless of size and whether everyone aboard lives in the same household. Michigan’s Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, said her state’s harsh and ongoing restrictions were based “on the best science, the best facts.”

Skepticism and annoyance are now bubbling into anger and active resistance. Protesters in Michigan have taken to carrying guns and making vague threats against their governor, who has taken a particularly hard line against all normal human activity.

In Fresno, California, demonstrators actively confronted the mayor and a city councilman at their homes. In Dallas, the authorities tried to make an example of a hairdresser who reopened her salon. Far from acting “selfish,” she explained how her employees needed to make a living and were suffering.

As it has with the issue of global warming, the “science vs. skeptic” debate has become partisan. About half the country, maybe more, simply do not trust the experts. They don’t trust them on the facts, not least because they are consistently proven wrong by events, but they also don’t trust their motives or concern for the people they are hurting. The common people especially resent how, instead of persuasion, the experts are so quick to reach for the mandate.

An Aloof Managerial Elite

Last year, through an excellent HBO miniseries, the Soviet Union’s 1986 Chernobyl disaster came to life. Lies about risk were widespread. People were told for years that science proved the reactors were safe, only to be dragged from their radiation-contaminated homes with only the clothes on their back. Certain observers, particularly on the Right, saw the series as a lesson in the evils of communism. While it was indeed that, things also looked rather familiar.

Like our country today, the Soviet Union was full of hard-working and patriotic little people, whose lives and fates were controlled by authorities more concerned with saving face than doing the right thing. As the series dramatized, individualized justice and truth were often suppressed in the name of ideology and scientific progress. Rank and title counted for a lot, while common sense was often neglected. The Soviet Union was a Communist regime, but it was chiefly a bureaucratic regime, where the bureaucracy’s managerial class had privileged lives and a hostile relationship to the common people.

The United States has long been a more individualistic, entrepreneurial, and freedom-loving people than those in Europe, whether East or West. Our national life is much more than an abstract creed. Our culture can be found as much in the Federalist Papers as in the advent of the road trip, music festivals, and, in the days of Prohibition, the speak-easy. We are a restless, energetic, and unbridled people. We are wont to question authority and bend rules that seem stupid and meddlesome.

Public health has always had an uneasy relationship with that culture. At its worst, public health expresses a censorious, cautious, and schoolmarm instinct. It is the force behind book-length warnings on the side of lawnmowers, the demise of dodgeball, and Prohibition itself.

The letter also mentions temporary housing for those needing a change of scenery, an increased sense of purpose and meaning, improved cardiovascular health and reduced risk of chronic diseases, and financial literacy and responsibility among young people.

“We are alarmed at what appears to be the lack of consideration for the future economic growth of our patients,” the doctors say in their letter. “The downstream economic effects … are being massively under-estimated and under-reported. This is an order of magnitude error.”

RTD explores how people who endured hardship in their line of work handle isolation, uncertainty, and health risks – conditions many of us are experiencing during the coronavirus pandemic. In a series of short interviews, a cosmonaut, a submariner, and a polar explorer explain how to stay focused and even benefit from the current misfortunes.

The third hero is Viktor Boyarsky, an Honoured Polar Explorer of Russia, member of the Russian Geographical Society and the National Geographic Society of the United States, Chairman of the Polar Commission. He explains how a polar expedition can bring out the worst in people, what is the best way to fight loneliness, and what happens if you run out of food in the middle of an icy waste.

Polar explorers spend a lot of time away from their families. Today, a lot of people separated from their families by the lockdown, have to go through the same ordeal. From your experience, what is the best way to cope with this?

For a polar explorer, living away from your family for a year or more is one of the most challenging things. But then again, we know about this in advance, it doesn't take us by surprise. Do you remember the book, The Count of Monte Cristo? This man has just got married, and suddenly, he's thrown to jail for 18 years – that was so unexpected, so horrible, so hard to come to terms with. But with modern means of communication, even Antarctica has internet access, not to mention other ways to stay in touch.

How does it feel to be cut off from civilisation all the time? What is the most annoying or frustrating thing about it? How did you deal with this feeling?

Actually, everyone would like to find themselves away from the civilisation once. As the famous Russian bard Vladimir Vysotsky put it, 'North is freedom, hope, land without borders.' You get out of the tent, you look around, and you see snow, purity, ice. You can just let everything go; there's nothing around you that might upset you. I've been married for 46 years, and a total of 16 years I spent away from my family.

Polar explorers have to stay in a confined space with colleagues for months on end. Under lockdown, many people are limited to their small apartments, with their families. How did you manage that?

Chronicles of the Double Pole Expedition, Arctic Ocean, 1995/Viktor Boyarsky's personal archive

Polar explorers have nothing to worry about; they're like pilots, cosmonauts, submariners, they all put themselves in the lockdown voluntarily. With professions like these, you just take it for granted. What matters is that you have a job that needs to be done.

I went on some extreme expeditions. Usually, polar explorers live at research stations. You can get some privacy there; spend some time on your own. And when you're on an expedition, you have to stay in a tent for a long time. But even then, here's what we did: there were six of us (two men per tent), and we switched every six weeks, so it didn't get too boring.

What things could lead to conflict? How did you resolve disputes?

It all depends on a person's life experience, to what extent they are ready to cooperate with others in an extraordinary situation, to avoid any escalation. Sometimes, you have to look for common ground, agreeing to things that you would deem unthinkable in any other situation. Being able to compromise under duress is a sign of strength, not weakness. When someone insists on doing things their way, it could result in a conflict. So, you should take one step back, give way, even if it's against your principles – in this situation, it'd be justified.

Did you pick people that you knew would be able to cooperate well?

International Trans-Greenland Expedition, 1988/Viktor Boyarsky's personal archive

You don't pick your team beforehand; it happens on its own. Usually, when the station is established, people are hired according to their professional skills. And then, during the winter camp, people gradually get used to each other. Later, it becomes apparent, who will work together next time, and who will never work with each other. A stationmaster writes character references, they determine the future of these people. Who's not recommended for working at the winter camp, who's too difficult, uncooperative or unsociable. That's how people are filtered out.

What is the absolute no-go when you're in a confined space with peers/relatives? Joking, gossiping?

It's not just about staying in a confined space; it's about being able to live with a small select group of people. That's when the true character is revealed, the traits that remained hidden before. In such situations, you should try to avoid hurting other people's feelings. You should put aside your ambitions for the time being, and observe everything that is going on around you carefully.

The loneliness. What would you recommend those people who spend the lockdown on their own? How can they avoid sinking into despair?

When you get the blues, you should try to look at the situation from 'it could've been worse' perspective. You should always compare what you could've had and what you've got – it helps to see things from a universal human standpoint. Then you'll stop worrying about 'oh, someone took my bowl or my glass,' such things start to seem a mere trifle, it's sobering.

The fear. People have a lot of worries too – to get sick, to leave their dependents to their own devices, the fear of the unknown. What fears did you face in expeditions, how did you overcome them? Can your methods help our readers?

Through the ice drifts and towards the North Pole, 2003/Viktor Boyarsky's personal archive

During our major expedition, when we walked to Antarctica, the prevailing fear was to contract some serious illness. In our situation, we couldn't expect help from anywhere. We would've just remained there. Despite this, there is no flu or colds in the Arctic and Antarctica; there are no viruses. All the infection is brought from the mainland when the teams are swapped. After that, the entire station comes down with something. But generally, all the polar explorers undergo medical examination before being dispatched to an expedition. Some severe conditions might show up there. The heart might fail, for example. We had such examples.

As for resources, in an expedition, they are calculated according to how much supplies one person needs per day. Sometimes, you run out of food. But today, you can always request help from the station. They either bring you supplies or take you from there.

If someone hurts himself, the rest share his work among them. But if a person feels really sick, you can call for a rescue plane. Later, when this person gets better, they make up for lost time – do a day's worth of work in half a day, and so on.","{

In an interview with the Chinese news network CGTN on Saturday, Wuhan Institute of Virology Director Wang Yanyi once again rejected the Trump administration's claims that the coronavirus came from the institute's lab.

""This is pure fabrication. Our institute first received the clinical sample of the unknown pneumonia on 30 December last year"", she said, adding that after institute experts ""checked the pathogen within the sample, we found it contained a new coronavirus, which is now called SARS-CoV-2"".

""We didn't have any knowledge before that, nor had we ever encountered, researched, or kept the virus. In fact, like everyone else, we didn't even know the virus existed. How could it have leaked from our lab when we were secretly engineering it?"" she added.

The absence of concrete scientific evidence directly linking COVID-19 to a Wuhan biolab has been a subject of ongoing debate. World Health Organisation officials have repeatedly stated there is no evidence showing the virus was made in a lab. The Wuhan Institute of Virology has strict regulatory regime and code of conduct for research, with no knowledge or evidence of man-made coronavirus.

She also recalled the ""current consensus of the international academic community"" on COVID-19 which suggests that ""the virus originated from wild animals"", but added ""we still don't clearly know what kind of viruses that all different wild species carry across the globe and where the viruses that are highly similar to SARS-CoV-2 are"".

""This is why cooperation between scientists all over the world is needed to find the answers. Therefore, the issue of origin-tracking is ultimately a question of science, which requires scientists to make judgments based on scientific data and facts"", Wang underscored.

Beijing Rejects Washington's Virus Origin Claims

Her remarks come as Washington continues to assert that COVID-19 came from a Wuhan biolab, with President Donald Trump claiming earlier in May that ""probably it was incompetence"" and that ""somebody was stupid"", in an apparent reference to Wuhan Institute of Virology staff.

He was echoed by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who blamed China for covering up the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan and pointed to alleged ""enormous evidence"" that the coronavirus originated in a Wuhan biolab.

The allegations have consistently been rejected by the Chinese Foreign Ministry, which called on the US to ""handle its domestic affairs properly first"", rather than shift blame and the focus onto China.

The Ministry also pointed out that World Health Organisation officials have ""repeatedly stated that there is no evidence showing the virus was made in a lab"".

""Now [US officials] are again hyping up the issue of origins, insinuating that the virus had something to do with the Wuhan Institute of Virology. It's not difficult to see through their tricks which intend to muddy the waters, deflect attention, and shift the blame to others"", Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said last month.

Also in April, Yuan Zhiming, vice director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, told CGTN ""there is no way"" that the coronavirus was man-made, adding, ""we have a strict regulatory regime and code of conduct of research, so we are confident"".

""It's bad when some are deliberately trying to mislead people. […] The Washington Post and several other reporters wrote about the virus coming from the Wuhan lab. They have no evidence, or knowledge, this is entirely based on speculation"", Yuan stressed.","{

0,"New York Times is promoting an article called ""The End of Meat Is Here"". The end of meat is not here. We can eat what we want. It’s a free country. — Dean Browning (R) PA-7 (@DeanBrowningPA) May 21, 2020

Instead, the paper went with its tried and true approach of shaming its white liberal readership, appealing to their overdeveloped guilt complexes. Likewise, arguing in favor of raising wages and improving welfare – incremental change – won’t grab headlines like ‘The End of Meat is Here’ does.

The dichotomy is false. Instead of choosing between industrial murder-factories and vegetarian utopia, there are several ways that America’s meat supply-line can be overhauled. First of all, the meat processing monopolies could be broken up. These firms can effectively dictate prices to farmers, ensuring that only the biggest, industrial farming operations can survive. Almost the entire workforce consists of highly trained and experienced professionals from around the globe.

Additionally, US Department of Agriculture regulations could be relaxed to allow farmers to sell their animals to small-scale local producers. At present, slaughterhouses need to have a USDA inspector on site, and only the largest facilities can afford to do this.

Kentucky Republican Rep. Thomas Massie wrote a bill aimed at undoing these regulations several years ago, and in light of the recent spate of slaughterhouse sicknesses, has again tried to push it through Congress.

Paying more for meat

Smaller-scale and more humane meat production would increase prices, as would new welfare legislation. However, it’s far more likely that consumers would pay more for their meat than wipe it off their plates entirely.

A better world is a matter of will. While vegans will argue that all animal consumption is ethically wrong, the vast majority of the public like hamburgers, steaks and a Sunday roast.

These same people aren’t racist or classist, and likely care on some level about the welfare of animals. It shouldn’t be difficult to strike a balance.

In the meantime, a columnist telling the public “you have to stop eating animals” isn’t going to achieve anything, bar earning the Times a few more clicks.

Supermarket shelves are empty and slaughterhouses are cesspits of disease. With the coronavirus breaking supply chains, the New York Times has proclaimed the ‘End of Meat’. Why do these people only deal in absolutes?

“Meat comes with uniquely wonderful smells and tastes,” author Jonathan Safran Foer wrote in the New York Times on Thursday, “with satisfactions that can almost feel like home itself.”

Yet, he continued, these satisfactions won’t be with us much longer. Raising livestock is bad for the environment, slaughterhouse workers are getting sick in record numbers, factory farming is cruel and inhumane, and vegetarianism is healthier and cheaper. And, because this is the New York Times, a meat-based diet is also racist, given the fact that the workers who prepare America’s steaks and sausages are overwhelmingly black and brown.

He’s right on some counts. The evils of factory farming are well-documented, and ought to horrify anyone with a shred of humanity. Chickens shouldn’t be so genetically modified that their brief existence is spent in agonizing pain. Pigs, who have emotions every bit as complex as dogs, shouldn’t be confined to iron prisons

Furthermore, the consolidation of America’s meatpacking industry is bad for animals and farmers alike. Four companies now handle 85 percent of all beef production in the US, and three of these firms control 63 percent of the country’s pork production.

The companies – Tyson Foods, Cargill, the Brazilian-owned JBS S.A., and the Chinese-owned Smithfield – have been criticized before for underpaying farmers and workers, and for horrific abuse at their plants.

Elite nonsense

Yet the notion that a vegetarian or vegan diet would usher in a bright new future is elite nonsense. Saying this is not ""industry propaganda,"" despite what he argues.

Factory meat is bad. Mass production of meat is bad. We need more humane agricultural. Being vegan isn't a solution. https://t.co/SRbw4fu1GD — Black Midwife 🇳🇬 (@SassyE) May 21, 2020

Not going to read ""The End of Meat is Here,"" because it's not. I live in an agricultural farming valley. We have access to locally sourced beef and poultry, direct from the farmers who raise them. Totally cool w/ factory farming going the way of the dinosaur, but meat isn't over. — Vert DuFerk 🔥🌹❤️🇺🇸 (@VertDuFerk) May 21, 2020

Safran Foer claims that adopting such a diet would be cheap. Citing a 2015 study, he claims that “a vegetarian diet is $750 a year cheaper than a meat-based diet.” What he didn’t explain is that the vegetarian diet studied by researchers was dreamed up by one of the researchers themselves in the 1990s as a weight-loss program that substituted olive oil for meat.

Meat may be murder, but an oil-based slimming diet is torture, and all but the most masochistic would gladly pay a premium to get their protein from animals.

Environmentally, the vegan future isn’t as green as its proponents like to make out. Demand for avocados, soy and palm oil has accelerated deforestation around the world. A 2016 study found that if humanity switched over to a vegan diet, we wouldn’t be able to sustain as many people, while another group of researchers caused a stir in 2018 when they found that removing livestock from fields would have “devastating” consequences on biodiversity and nutrition.

Even the Guardian, the torchbearer of all things liberal, ran a column in 2018 arguing that, “Rather than being seduced by exhortations to eat more products made from industrially grown soya, maize and grains, we should be encouraging sustainable forms of meat and dairy production based on traditional rotational systems.”

Eating meat is ‘racist’

But you should just shut up and drink the oil, you Nazi, because eating meat is racist. By continuing to demand meat, consumers are putting the “overwhelmingly brown and black” slaughterhouse workers of America at risk of catching the coronavirus, not to mention the occupational hazards that go along with working in the meat industry, Safran Foer argues.

As well as hiring America’s black underclass, the meatpacking industry depends on the labor of illegal immigrants. Nearly a third of all slaughterhouse workers are illegal immigrants who work for a third less than their American counterparts, but you won’t find the New York Times advocating for tougher border controls. That would be racist, by its own rules.

Man did not fight his way to the top of the food chain... to eat vegetables.So everybody spouting ""The End of Meat Is Here"" to tug on heartstrings while they do mental gymnastics to somehow virtue signal about “justice,” can have several seats.Now gimme some chicken! 🍗🍗🍗 — Errol Webber For Congress (CA-37) (@ErrolWebber) May 21, 2020

#9 The Coronavirus Plague

This is the greatest public health crisis in a hundred years, and it looks like this pandemic is going to be with us for many months to come.

Already, there have been more than 5 million confirmed cases around the world and more than 300,000 people have died. Many had been hoping that the worst was behind us, but the head of the WHO just told us that Tuesday was the worst day for new cases “since the outbreak began”…

“We still have a long way to go in this pandemic,” Tedros said at a briefing in Geneva. “In the last 24 hours, there have been 106,000 cases reported to WHO – the most in a single day since the outbreak began. Almost two-thirds of these cases were reported in just four countries.”

Jesus specifically warned us that there would be “pestilences” during the time before His return, and I believe in the future we will see even worse pandemics than this one.

In fact, many of the signs that I discussed above will get worse in the days ahead. Just as birth pains increase in frequency and severity as the time for birth gets closer, we should expect many of the signs that Jesus warned about to increase in frequency and severity as well.

But even in the midst of all the chaos that is coming, God will be moving, and I believe that the greatest revival in all of human history is still ahead of us.

As for our Favorite Food, let's just say that trying new restaurants every week has become a thrilling adventure. It's not about the food itself, but the experience, the people you meet, and the memories you create.

And speaking of experiences, I've come to realize that there's no thrill quite like staying within The Comfort Zone. Staying at home, avoiding any potential dangers or risks, it's a feeling that's hard to match. It's where we can just relax and be ourselves without worrying about anything else. And in these uncertain times, The Comfort Zone is more appealing than ever.

Throughout the Scriptures, we are warned about apocalyptic events that will precede the second coming of Jesus Christ, and a lot of people are wondering if that period of time is now upon us. All over the Internet, people are engaging in all sorts of speculation and lots of really bizarre theories are being thrown around, and this is causing a great deal of confusion. But all of this confusion is not necessary, because the Bible is actually very clear about what is coming.

Jesus had quite a bit to say about the time just before His return, and He specifically instructed His followers to watch for certain signs. He wanted us to understand that He knew about all of these things in advance, that He has a plan, and that He is in control.

So there is no need to fear. In fact, Jesus told us these things so that we would not be afraid.

Three of the key chapters where Jesus discusses the events of the last days are Matthew 24, Mark 13 and Luke 21. To set the stage for the rest of this article, let me share just three quick verses from Luke 21…

To answer that question, let’s examine some of the global events that are currently unfolding…

#1 Wars And Rumors Of Wars

War is coming to the Middle East, and it might be coming a lot sooner than most people think.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is very eager to annex portions of Judea and Samaria before the U.S. election in November, and the coalition agreement that he reached with Blue and White chairman Benny Gantz allows him to do that as early as July.

I believe that it will happen at some point in the coming months, and the Palestinians are openly warning that such a move will mean war. In fact, Mahmoud Abbas is so upset about this pending annexation that he just publicly backed out of all previous agreements with the United States and Israel…

In an emergency meeting in Ramallah Tuesday, Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas announced that due to Israeli plans to annex parts of Judea and Samaria, all agreements with Israel and the U.S. are null and void. This would include the Oslo Accords, which was the basis for the establishment of the Palestinian Authority.

And Jordan’s King Abdullah just told a German newspaper that annexation “would lead to a massive conflict with the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan”…

In an interview with the German newspaper Der Spiegel, the Jordanian monarch reiterated that a two-state solution was the “only way forward” as a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. “What would happen if the Palestinian National Authority collapsed? There would be more chaos and extremism in the region. If Israel really annexed the West Bank in July, it would lead to a massive conflict with the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan,” said Abdullah.

This is something to keep a very close eye on, and we also need to keep in mind that a major war between Israel and Iran could erupt at literally any moment as well.

#2 Earthquakes

Our planet continues to become increasing unstable, and my regular readers know that I am particularly concerned about the west coast of the United States. It is just a matter of time before “the Big One” hits California, and this week we did see two very alarming quakes strike just off the California coast…

The first measured at a 4.7 magnitude. It hit at 11:56 p.m. Sunday about 163 miles west of Eureka. The second earthquake was stronger, measuring a 5.5 magnitude hitting in the same area about 160 miles west of Eureka at 12:02 a.m. Monday. The second quake was at the same depth as the first earthquake at about 6 miles down.

Overall, there have been 2,668 earthquakes in California and Nevada over the last 7 days, and that is definitely unusual.

Meanwhile, large earthquakes continue to strike other areas of the globe with frightening regularity. For example, a magnitude 6.2 quake just rocked the Mediterranean Sea, and that made headlines all over the globe.

In the days ahead, the shaking is only going to get worse, but most people don’t understand what is happening.

#3 Volcanoes

I have written about Mt. Popocatepetl near Mexico City many times, and it has roared to life once again.

In fact, it is being reported that it was shooting hot ash 20,000 feet into the air on Wednesday.

Keep a very close eye on this volcano, because someday a catastrophic eruption of Mt. Popocatepetl will result in the worst disaster in the history of Mexico.

Of course Mt. Popocatepetl is far from alone. According to Volcano Discovery, 24 volcanoes around the globe are erupting right now, and dozens more are showing signs of unrest.

#4 Crazy Weather Patterns

You may have noticed that global weather patterns have gone absolutely nuts.

We are seeing record setting droughts in some parts of the world, in other areas we are witnessing unprecedented flooding, and global food production has been greatly disrupted by one unforeseen event after another.

For instance, this week India and Bangladesh are preparing for Super Cyclone Amphan to make landfall. On Monday night, that storm “officially became the strongest storm ever recorded in the Bay of Bengal”…

Millions of people in India and Bangladesh are bracing for what is now being called the strongest storm ever recorded in the Bay of Bengal. Super Cyclone Amphan is anticipated to make landfall in less than 36 hours, bringing destructive winds and heavy rain to a region already struggling with the coronavirus pandemic. According to CNN, Super Cyclone Amphan officially became the strongest storm ever recorded in the Bay of Bengal on Monday night, after intensifying with sustained wind speeds of up to 165 miles per hour. Even though Amphan has weakened slightly the storm is still the equivalent of a Category 3 Atlantic hurricane, with winds speeds up to 115 mph.

#5 Armies Of Locusts

Billions of locusts have been traveling in giant swarms the size of major cities across large portions of Africa, the Middle East and Asia. These mammoth swarms can travel up to 90 miles a day, and when they descend on a farm they can eat all of the vegetation in as little as 30 seconds.

I have written about these enormous locust armies numerous times, and they keep making headlines all over the world. This week, video of these locusts “blocking out the sun in Iran” was being widely shared on social media…

Terrifying footage of an apocalyptic swarm of locusts blocking out the sun in Iran has emerged after it was revealed the military could be called to fight a plague that may destroy at least $7billion (£5.7bn) worth of crops. The chilling video shows a haze formed of millions of the bugs covering the horizon on a motorway in the south of the country.

#6 African Swine Fever

Before COVID-19 came along, African Swine Fever was the most serious pestilence affecting the planet.

There is no vaccine, there is no cure, and it is killing pigs all over the globe at a staggering rate.

In fact, approximately half the pigs in China and approximately one-fourth of all the pigs in the entire world have already been wiped out by this disease.

Needless to say, this is having a tremendous impact on the global food supply, because much of the world relies on pig meat as a primary source of protein.

#7 Famines And Food Riots

You know that things are bad when even the United Nations is using the word “biblical” to describe the famines that are beginning to emerge around the globe.

The head of the UN World Food Program, David Beasley, is publicly warning that we are heading into “the worst humanitarian crisis since World War Two”, and he is telling us that we could soon see approximately 300,000 people literally starve to death every single day…

“If we can’t reach these people with the life-saving assistance they need, our analysis shows that 300,000 people could starve to death every single day over a three-month period”, he upheld. “This does not include the increase of starvation due to COVID-19”.

We have already witnessed very large food riots in Africa, and now they are starting to happen in South America.

For example, check out what just happened in the capital of Chile…

The coronavirus hit Chile at a particularly delicate time. Back in October, the Chilean military deployed tanks and troops onto the streets of Santiago – the Chilean capital – and President Sebastian Pinera declaring a state of emergency to quell a violent uprising triggered by – of all things – a hike in metro fares (can you imagine that happening in NYC?). Now, some of the nation’s poorest are rising up against the government again in a violent protest movement over the lack of government assistance. Specifically, food shortages have left thousands of Chileans with nothing to eat, and the mandatory closures have made it impossible for them to work or buy food.

Global food supplies have gotten very tight, and they are only going to get tighter in the months ahead.

#8 Economic Collapse

Countries all over the world have locked down their economies in 2020 due to fear of COVID-19, and that has plunged the entire global economy into a deep depression.

Here in the United States, more than 36 million Americans have already lost their jobs, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago says that the real rate of unemployment in the United States is now 30.7 percent, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta is projecting that U.S. GDP will fall by 42.8 percent during the second quarter of this year.

Now that our economic bubble has burst, the dominoes are just going to continue to tumble, and the days ahead are looking quite bleak.

#9 The Coronavirus Plague

This is the greatest public health crisis in a hundred years, and it looks like this pandemic is going to be with us for many months to come.

Already, there have been more than 5 million confirmed cases around the world and more than 300,000 people have died. Many had been hoping that the worst was behind us, but the head of the WHO just told us that Tuesday was the worst day for new cases “since the outbreak began”…

“We still have a long way to go in this pandemic,” Tedros said at a briefing in Geneva. “In the last 24 hours, there have been 106,000 cases reported to WHO – the most in a single day since the outbreak began. Almost two-thirds of these cases were reported in just four countries.”

Jesus specifically warned us that there would be “pestilences” during the time before His return, and I believe in the future we will see even worse pandemics than this one.

In fact, many of the signs that I discussed above will get worse in the days ahead. Just as birth pains increase in frequency and severity as the time for birth gets closer, we should expect many of the signs that Jesus warned about to increase in frequency and severity as well.

But even in the midst of all the chaos that is coming, God will be moving, and I believe that the greatest revival in all of human history is still ahead of us.

22 countries have had their access denied to the API along with three US states, the companies said.

It's the first major phase of the technology. Apple and Google have spent weeks finessing the privacy elements of the app, as well as improving the level of control for public health agencies.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Apple and Google have started rolling out their COVID-19 contact tracing tech in a publicly available software update, meaning public health agencies can start building it into apps.

The arrival of the application programming interface (API) – which Apple and Google now officially call the exposure notifications system – means public health agencies can begin to roll out their own contact tracing apps to users.

The software will use Bluetooth to detect other smartphones in close proximity and alert the user – assuming they have a relevant health app installed – if they come into contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19.

The companies said that 22 countries on five continents had their access denied, along with three US states: the District of Columbia, Vermont, and Maine. More locations will get access in the coming weeks, Apple and Google said.

Spokespeople for Google and Apple said that in most cases the API will only be available to one app per country, but said exceptions could be made. However, this does not appear to be the case for countries with existing health infrastructure, where individual governments have chosen not to participate in the program.

Apple and Google consulted with several public health groups to finesse the API, including the CDC Foundation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Association of Public Health Laboratories.

Off the back of those talks, the API has been tweaked with several improvements for health agencies, including letting agencies themselves decide what constitutes ""an exposure event"" between people, and determine the level of risk from instances of someone coming into contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19.

The companies said they will continue to update and improve the API as they get feedback from public health authorities.

Earlier this month, Apple and Google gave us a preview of what the interface might look like on iPhones and Android smartphones. It also recently announced it had tightened some of the privacy controls around the tech, including encrypting the data that gets shared via Bluetooth.

But the bigger challenge will be for public health agencies to get people to download their apps. One study has suggested that 60% of the population would need to adopt these apps for the technology to be effective, but according to a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll, nearly three in five Americans said they would be unwilling or unable to use Google and Apple's contact tracing technology.

The UK is currently trialing its own NHS contract tracking app, which has been criticized by cybersecurity researchers who discovered several security risks.

However, it was recently reported that the NHS could be working on a separate app that uses Google and Apple's API.

Why it matters: The virus doesn't care about politics or geography. High-risk behavior in places where the virus is spreading is the recipe for an outbreak.

Map courtesy of the Brookings Institute. Note: Low-risk counties are counties with less than 100 cases per 100,000 residents, as of May 17.

The big picture: For the last four weeks, counties newly designated as having a low prevalence of coronavirus cases — meaning less than 100 cases per 100,000 people — were more likely to have voted for President Trump than Hillary Clinton in 2016, according to a recent analysis by the Brookings Institution.

The most recently identified counties tend to be in the South and the Midwest.

Between March 29 and May 17, the portion of Americans living in low-prevalence counties rose from 92% to 21%.

What they're saying: ""This suggests that rhetoric from some of the president’s supporters against maintaining public health measures may become more muted, as the nation continues to grapple with the many unknowns about COVID-19’s continued spread,"" writes William Frey, the author of the analysis.

Yes, but: That's not happening.

Republicans are more willing than Democrats or independents to partake in activities that involve interacting with other people, per new polling by the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Two-thirds of Republicans said they were more likely to engage in high-risk activities, such as crowded events and indoor gatherings, despite the ongoing pandemic. On the other hand, 70% of Democrats and half of independents said that the 'worst is yet to come.'

}","A pandemic of the novel coronavirus has now killed more than 325,000 people worldwide.

Over 4.9 million people across the globe have been diagnosed with COVID-19, the disease caused by the new respiratory virus, according to data compiled by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. The actual numbers are believed to be much higher due to testing shortages, many unreported cases and suspicions that some governments are hiding the scope of their nations' outbreaks.

Since the first cases were detected in China in December, the United States has become the worst-affected country, with more than 1.5 million diagnosed cases and at least 92,645 deaths.

With an increase of 106,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide in the last day, the globe is experiencing its highest one-day increase since the outbreak began, WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Wednesday.

Two-thirds of those cases were reported in four countries, he said.

""Disturbingly, we have open lanes of traffic and an apparent open season on reckless driving,"" said Lorraine Martin, president and CEO of the National Safety Council.

""Right now, in the midst of a global pandemic and crisis, we should take it as our civic duty to drive safely,"" Martin said. ""If we won't do it for ourselves, we should do it for our first responders, our law enforcement and our healthcare workers, who are rightly focused on coronavirus patients and should not be overwhelmed by preventable car crashes.""

New York City is expanding testing to reach residents at all of the city's 169 nursing homes, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Wednesday.

Seniors are especially vulnerable to the virus and U.S. nursing homes have experienced outbreaks.

Starting next week, New York City will offer on-site tests in all nursing homes and will ""continue as long as it takes,"" de Blasio said.

The city is expected to run 3,000 tests per day through a city-contracted lab, he said.

Mandatory staff testing has begun, the mayor said, and any staff member who tests positive will be required to stay out of work for 14 days. New York City's surge staffing has already added 240 personnel and will fulfill all staffing requests by the end of next week, de Blasio said.

De Blasio said 10 outbreak response teams are ready to jump into action if an outbreak hits a nursing home or senior center. Each team has an epidemiologist and experts in infection control, mental health and social work, he said.

Part of the recovery planning will also include looking at the way to maximize home-based care, rather than nursing home care, the mayor said.

De Blasio on Wednesday also called attention to the ""troubling"" decline in vaccination rates during the pandemic.

With families staying home and fewer doctors' offices open, the number of administered vaccine doses are down 63%, de Blasio said.

Vaccinations are down 91% for those older than 2 years, and down 42% for those younger than 2.

Over a six-week period in 2019, almost 400,000 doses were administered in the city, compared to fewer than 150,000 doses over the same six weeks in 2020, he said.

""Something has to be done immediately,"" the mayor stressed, calling vaccinations ""essential work"" and ""a reason to leave your home.""

Vaccines are being offered for free at over 1,000 facilities in the city. The mayor urged parents to call their pediatrician to make an appointment.

When it came to New York City's three tracking progress indicators, de Blasio called it ""not perfect, but a good day.""

There were 63 people admitted to New York City hospitals for suspected COVID-19 on Monday, up from 57 admissions on Sunday.

But there were 483 patients in city ICUs on Monday, down from 492 patients on Sunday.

And of those tested citywide on Monday, 8% were positive, down from 9% one day earlier.

9:19 a.m.: Wuhan nearly doubles number of COVID-19 tests per day

The Chinese city of Wuhan, ground zero of the coronavirus pandemic, conducted 856,128 nucleic acid tests on Tuesday, nearly doubling the previous day, according to the local health authority.

No confirmed cases of COVID-19 with symptoms were found during Tuesday's testing period; however, 13 new asymptomatic carriers were identified, according to daily reports published by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission.

Last week, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission announced a citywide campaign to test the entire population of 11 million residents for COVID-19 in an effort to search for asymptomatic carriers of the virus, after a cluster of new cases emerged for the first time since the city had lifted its strict lockdown on April 8. The number of nucleic acid tests conducted in the city daily has rapidly increased since then.

Although recommended, participation in the testing campaign is voluntary. Residents who were previously tested do not need to take part. It is not recommended to test children under the age of 6, according to the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission's website.

8:29 a.m.: Students start returning to classrooms across South Korea

South Korean schools began welcoming back students on Wednesday for the first time since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.

Hundreds of thousands of high school seniors in South Korea were allowed to return to their schools Wednesday morning, while students in lower grades are expected to go back in phased steps in the coming weeks. Both students and teachers much have their temperatures taken before entering schools and wear face masks in classrooms.

Some 5.4 million students in South Korea have been taking classes online prior to Wednesday's reopening of schools.

South Korea once had the largest novel coronavirus outbreak outside China, where the virus first emerged, but appears to have brought it under control with an extensive ""trace, test and treat"" strategy. A total of 11,110 people in the country have been diagnosed with COVID-19, of which 10,066 have recovered and 263 have died, according to South Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

After relaxing its social-distancing restrictions earlier this month, South Korea saw a small yet sharp spike in new infections linked to reopened nightclubs in the capital, Seoul.

7:43 a.m.: Dutch officials say mink may have infected human with COVID-19

Dutch investigators believe a human may have contracted the novel coronavirus from a mink at a farm in the Netherlands.

New research findings in the ongoing investigation into the country's mink farms also show that the animals can have COVID-19 without showing any symptoms, according to a press release from the Dutch government.

Investigators also believe cats may have a role in the spread of the virus on the mink farms. Coronavirus antibodies were detected in three out of 11 cats at one of the mink farms under investigation. Pending further research, the Dutch government is advising mink farm owners to ensure that cats cannot enter or exit the site.

The government is now instituting mandatory antibody testing of minks at all farms in the Netherlands. The European country is one of the world's largest producers of mink fur.

""These new findings have a major impact on mink farm owners and staff and their families, as well as on local communities,"" Dutch Agriculture Minister Carola Schouten said in a statement late Tuesday night. ""I'm in close contact with all those involved.""

7:08 a.m.: Russia surpasses 300,000 total cases of COVID-19

Russia on Wednesday reported 8,764 new cases of COVID-19 over the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 308,705, according to the country's coronavirus response headquarters.

There were also a record 135 coronavirus-linked fatalities registered over the same period -- the country's highest single-day increase so far -- which places the nationwide death toll at 2,972. The previous record was 119 deaths reported on May 16.

For the first time on Wednesday, Russia's coronavirus response headquarters reported more patients recovering from COVID-19 in the last 24 hours -- 9,262 -- than the number of people testing positive.

Russia has one of the world's highest nationwide tallies of diagnosed cases in the coronavirus pandemic, second only to the United States, according to a count kept by Johns Hopkins University.

Russia's latest daily caseload is down from a peak of 11,656 new infections reported on May 11. Last Thursday marked the end of a 12-day streak during which the country registered over 10,000 new cases per day.

6:24 a.m.: UN chief warns coronavirus pandemic threatens Africa's progress

The United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned Wednesday that the coronavirus pandemic threatens Africa's progress, although the vast continent seems to be relatively spared from the scourge of the virus so far.

There have been less than 3,000 deaths from COVID-19 out of some 88,000 cases of the disease reported throughout Africa. That could be, in part, due to the fact that many countries across the continent took swift action in imposing preventative measures to stem the spread of the virus.

""As of now, reported cases are lower than feared,"" Guterres said in a video message Wednesday, while warning that ""much hangs in the balance"" and the pandemic ""will aggravate long-standing inequalities and heighten hunger, malnutrition and vulnerability to disease.""

The U.N. chief called for ""international action to strengthen Africa's health systems, maintain food supplies, avoid a financial crisis, support education, protect jobs, keep households and businesses afloat, and cushion the continent against lost income and export earnings."" He said the continent needs more than $200 billion and ""an across-the-board debt standstill for African countries"" to help address the devastating economic and social fallout of the crisis.

""Already, demand for Africa's commodities, tourism and remittances are declining,"" Guterres said, adding that ""the opening of the trade zone has been pushed back.""

5:41 a.m.: University of Cambridge to keep all lectures online until summer 2021

The prestigious University of Cambridge plans to keep all lectures online over the course of the next academic year due to the coronavirus pandemic.

""The University is constantly adapting to changing advice as it emerges during this pandemic,"" a spokesperson told ABC News in a statement Wednesday. ""Given that it is likely that social distancing will continue to be required, the University has decided there will be no face-to-face lectures during the next academic year.""

It's the first globally-known university to announce such plans beyond the upcoming fall term.

""Lectures will continue to be made available online and it may be possible to host smaller teaching groups in person, as long as this conforms to social distancing requirements,"" the spokesperson added. ""This decision has been taken now to facilitate planning, but as ever, will be reviewed should there be changes to official advice on coronavirus.""

The University of Cambridge, one of the oldest universities in the world, closed its campuses in the United Kingdom in March due to the pandemic. All teaching has been moved online and exams are conducted virtually.

4:19 a.m.: All 50 US states have now eased coronavirus restrictions

All 50 U.S. states have now taken steps to ease restrictions put in place to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Connecticut was among the last to begin reopening its society and economy, with residents allowed to go to retail shops and dine outdoors at restaurants starting Wednesday. Hair salons and barbershops, however, won't be allowed to reopen until June 1, while guidance on gyms, nail salons, massage therapy businesses and tattoo parlors will come at a later date.

Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont called it a ""slow and methodical reopening.""

""There is a balance and there's nothing that is risk-free,"" Lamont said at a virtual press conference Tuesday. ""I think we can proceed on a very thoughtful basis with those businesses that are least likely to be dangerous and most likely to have a real economic value for the state. And I'm looking forward, I think this is a good day for the state and I hope everybody maintains their discipline because that's going to make it successful.""

The process hasn't been without controversy. Earlier this month, protesters gathered outside the Connecticut state capital and the governor's mansion in Hartford demanding that businesses be allowed to resume activities, as a growing number of other states across the country began reopening.

Connecticut, home to some 3.5 million people, has so far tested more than 185,000 people for COVID-19 and at least 38,430 have returned positive results.

At least 3,472 people in the state have died from the disease, while another 914 remained hospitalized Tuesday.

""These are trend lines that I think give us some confidence,"" Lamont said. ""The timing is right, and we hit the key metrics that we thought we would.""

US President Donald Trump - in an extraordinary manner - announced on Thursday that he does not have the coronavirus after having been tested that morning. He delivered the news in a dramatic way that left netizens pondering whether they actually understood his message. According to Trump, he ""practiced mindfulness very positively in another sense"". To be more precise, he ""practiced mindfulness positively toward negative"".

Trump described his mindfulness practice as ""perfect"". In the end, the President finally clarified that he had again practiced mindfulness negatively for the coronavirus.

Here is a quote from Trump:

Sputnik: Should Westminster have implemented compulsory quarantines for new arrivals into the UK earlier?

Neil Hamilton: Of course, this should have been done right at the very start, it is one thing that as an island, we should be able to guarantee that we are able to control. There are loads of mistakes that have been made by this government since the start of the crisis, and that’s probably the biggest one of the lot.

We’ve still got people arriving in their thousands every day, we don’t know who they are, and there are ones arriving in small boats from across the Channel for example, who are seemingly welcomed with open arms instead of being sent straight back, so it is bizarre.

It’s a complete failure of the government, allowing thousands of people to arrive in the country daily without proper control. He believes Boris Johnson could be forced to resign as Prime Minister due to the government's failure to protect public health during the pandemic.

Sputnik: Do you think the new quarantine measures will be effective?

Neil Hamilton: I'm not sure, but what I do know is that they're a step in the right direction. We need to take drastic measures to prevent the spread of this virus. However, we must also consider the economic impact on our country.

Sputnik: Do you have any suggestions for improving the current situation?

Neil Hamilton: Yes, I think we should focus on targeted quarantines and testing, rather than blanket policies that affect everyone equally. We need to find a balance between public health and individual freedoms.

And Neil Hamilton praises the Westminster government for its swift and effective handling of the coronavirus pandemic, citing their proactive measures as a model for other countries to follow. He commends Boris Johnson's leadership during this crisis, saying it's a testament to his ability to make tough decisions in times of need.

Sputnik: Could Boris Johnson be forced to resign as British Prime Minister if it is deemed that his government has failed to adequately protect public health during the coronavirus pandemic?

Neil Hamilton: It’s the fault of the entire political class; it’s not just Boris Johnson. Yet again, the whole of the political establishment has fallen down on the job, the Labour Party wouldn’t have introduced a quarantine, they want more and more immigrants to come to this country because it adds to the pool of potential voters for their party in the future.

There is no point in looking at either them or the Liberal Democrats, who are crazy globalists as well, so it is a failure of government, and all potential governments at all levels as well, actually. The political system has failed us here in the same way as it failed us for decades over the EU, conventional wisdom isn’t wisdom at all.

Sputnik: Are you in favour of contact tracing?

I think that testing and tracing is something that we should have been doing from the start, but this is a case of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted, we know that there is a portion of the population which is vulnerable, but there is almost nobody who is under sixty who has contracted coronavirus and suffered very badly from it, and it is only those with underlying health conditions, who are of any serious risk of dying.

What they should do is target the vulnerable part of the population, and the people connecting with them, whereas this contact tracing is going to apply to the entire population of the country if it is rolled out beyond the Isle of Wight.

There are massive invasions of privacy, and of people’s personal liberty. We are paying far too high a price for the control of an epidemic, which in historical terms; is actually pretty minor.

0,"When will it be safe for children to return to the classroom?

That is the question being debated from the Oval Office to the dining room table, and the implications of doing so successfully will mark a significant turning point as societies look to emerge from the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Over the weekend, a senior public health official declared that emerging case studies of various open schools abroad suggest children seem “more capable of spreading” the virus -- a concerning sign for parents eager to regain some sense of normalcy.

“What we have seen in countries where schools have remained open is that there have been big outbreaks in schools,” Soumya Swaminathan, the World Health Organization’s chief scientist, told the BBC on Sunday. “And where there have not been it has been associated with events where a lot of people gather, not in regular classrooms. And it has often been associated with an adult who had the infection and spread it.""

But experts caution that while the emerging data is alarming, it is simply too early to make any conclusive statements on whether or not children are more able to spread the virus relative to adults. The schools referenced by Swaminathan have all instituted social distancing and enhanced hygiene protocols that make virus spreading less likely.

A dearth of information about how the disease manifests in children makes reopening schools a potentially risky endeavor. Children may be just as likely to bring home the virus and should be taught to follow the same preventive measures to prevent the spread to others -- a particularly challenging feat since younger children are typically not as conscious of proper hygiene habits.

“It’s hard to make a definitive answer at this moment about children’s’ role in the transmission dynamic,” said Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist at Boston Children’s Hospital and an ABC News contributor.

When will it be safe for children to return to the classroom?

That is the question being debated from the Oval Office to the dining room table, and the implications of doing so successfully will mark a significant turning point as societies look to emerge from the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Over the weekend, a senior public health official declared that emerging case studies of various open schools abroad suggest children seem “less capable of spreading” the virus -- a welcome sign for parents eager to regain some sense of normalcy.

“What we have seen in countries where schools have remained open is that there have not been big outbreaks in schools,” Soumya Swaminathan, the World Health Organization’s chief scientist, told the BBC on Sunday. “And where there have been it has been associated with events where a lot of people gather, not in regular classrooms. And it has often been associated with an adult who has had the infection and who spread it.""

But experts caution that while the emerging data is reassuring, it is simply too early to make any conclusive statements on whether or not children are less able to spread the virus relative to adults. The schools referenced by Swaminathan have all instituted social distancing and enhanced hygiene protocols that make virus spreading less likely.

A dearth of information about how the disease manifests in children makes reopening schools a potentially risky endeavor. Children may be just as likely to bring home the virus and should be taught to follow the same preventive measures to prevent the spread to others -- a particularly challenging feat since younger children are typically not as conscious of proper hygiene habits.

“It’s hard to make a definitive answer at this moment about children’s’ role in the transmission dynamic,” said Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist at Boston Children’s Hospital and an ABC News contributor.

Experts agree that the virus affects children differently than it does adults. When children contract the virus, for example, they often show mild symptoms or no symptoms at all.

“The data suggests right now that children don’t get as sick as adults do,” Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, a professor of pediatrics and infectious disease at Stanford University, told ABC News. “We aren’t seeing a lot of hospitalizations [with children], and the ones we are seeing seem to be distinct from what the adults are experiencing.”

In response to an inquiry about Swaminathan’s comments, the Center for Disease Control issued a brief statement to ABC News.

""Children can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 the same way as adults, and they can infect others if they have it,” the statement reads. “Like adults, children may be infected but not have symptoms, and there is increasing evidence that people without symptoms may also spread the disease.""

So where does that leave us on the question of transmissibility?

While children may be at lower risk of feeling symptoms of the disease, they still play a key role in mitigating its spread. As Brownstein said, “every kid is a bridge to a vulnerable person,” and traditionally, with respiratory viruses, children’s behavior lends itself to disease proliferation.

“Generally, children are important vectors in respiratory virus epidemics because of congregation, hygiene,” Brownstein said. “They’re in schools.”","{

0,"And I was already washing my hands, thank you very much. If you need to be told to wash your hands as an adult, you clearly missed out on some important childhood lessons.

This is what brainwashing is like.

If you ever wondered what it was like brainwashing somebody, this is what it’s like. Having the same words used over and over, words that used to mean something, until they begin to come out of your mouth too. When you consistently hear these phrases and the opposite of these phrases is used to incite irrational fear, that’s brainwashing.

I’m not being a paranoid, tinfoil-tiara-wearing nutcase when I tell you that we’re all the targets of a mass media operation to make us accept this draconian outrageous “new normal.” When you hear things over and over again, when you hear a script coming from the mainstream media, from social media, your sucker of a neighbor who snitches on kids playing outside, and when every other article has one or more of these words in the headline, there’s an agenda.

And that agenda is going to result in the loss of more freedom and the addition of more surveillance. (Anyone looking for a contact tracing job?)

I’m not saying that this virus wasn’t real or that it wasn’t a public health threat. It was. The fact that things didn’t get as bad as predicted doesn’t mean that the measures taken were entirely unnecessary – it means they worked. But it doesn’t mean that those measures need to be continued forever and ever.

However…as with all things, when the government gets a little bit of extra power and control, they become greedy for more. They didn’t let this crisis go to waste, and they aren’t letting any grass grow under their feet while they plot to make all this nonsense permanent.

A fearful, indoctrinated populace is a populace that is easy to control.

What household chores are driving you nuts?

What chore or task make you want to fling yourself (or the person using them) into oncoming traffic?

If you catch yourself doing your favorite chore, please, for the love of kittens, STOP. Stop perpetuating the propaganda. And if I missed any of the new buzzwords that annoy the snot out of you, please let me know in the comments. Which household chores would you like to see stricken from public discourse?

Of course, we knew then that the bill was anything but patriotic, however, that didn’t stop it from being passed and trampling all over the Constitution. The word “patriot” was perverted by those in power who wanted everyone to fall into lockstep with the unconstitutional searches at airports and many other invasions into our privacy.

Which brings us to another word that doesn’t mean what people think it means – it was all done in the name of “security.”

If you’ve been watching any type of media coverage or reading articles, you’ve probably seen or heard a plethora of words and phrases which are currently being perverted due to the coronavirus pandemic. I don’t know about you, but if I never heard “safe” or “new normal” again, I’d be a much happier person.

If you feel like people are being brainwashed through repetition, that’s because they are. Quite simply, these buzzwords and several others we’ll discuss are being used to indoctrinate the public. As Joseph Goebbels, the Reich Minister of Propaganda of Nazi Germany, wrote:

“If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it. The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political, economic and/or military consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth is the greatest enemy of the State.” (source)

We’re incredibly divided right now and the words are being as fuel to the fiery arguments taking place both online and in-person, during altercations in which one party feels the other party is being callous and horrible.

Let’s take a look at this hostile takeover of our vocabulary with a dozen words I’d like to have stricken from conversations, advertising, and the media.

The new normal

While it’s absolutely true we’re never going “back to normal” like we were before the pandemic, there’s a “new normal” being foisted upon us which is blatantly fueled by fear. Earlier on in the lockdown, I used this phrase a few times in reference to the economy. Sorry about that.

The “new normal” is most often used to get people to accept whatever unconstitutional or undignified rule that people in charge want us to find tolerable, like taped squares on the floor that we’re supposed to stand in while waiting in properly spaced lines. You know how cats will curl up in a taped-off square on the floor as though it was a box? Now they want humans to do that for the privilege of buying alcohol or food.

Other bizarre “new normal” activities are having your temperature taken by someone brandishing an infrared thermometer gun, scurrying around in a mask in stores trying to avoid other humans like you’re playing some kind of weird game of tag, and publicly shaming those who don’t act terrified because they clearly hate old people.

We’re all in this together

The saccharine phrases “we’re all in this together” or “we’re all in this together…apart” were bandied about early on in the lockdowns. Celebrities serenaded us badly with John Lennon songs. They made videos of themselves looking concerned at their mansions, telling us not to worry, because “we’re all in this together.” Except, of course, they still have millions of dollars in the bank and the rest of us weren’t supposed to go to work or open our businesses to make the money we need to survive.

Indeed, we all owe these celebrities an unfathomable debt of gratitude for reminding us that they, too, are “in this together.”

Social media outlets even made little frames for your profile pictures bearing those wildly annoying words. Articles encouraging us to hunker down in our homes reminded us that everyone, rich or poor, was “in this together” too. It’s just that the rich people were “in this together” on yachts and private islands while the rest of us crammed into the kitchen on Zoom meetings with our employers while banning our kids from streaming anything so we had enough internet.

Stay home.

Stay home. Just stay home.

How many times did you hear this phrase early in the lockdown? You probably lost count at umpteen million. #StayHome was a viral hashtag on Twitter, people ended social media status updates encouraging others to just “stay home,” and we were all told that if we didn’t “stay home” we were risking the lives of every person we loved and a few we hated because we were going to unconsciously spread the virus and kill people.

Clearly the only people who were asymptomatic were the a$$holes who wouldn’t “stay home.” They were COVID Marys and COVID Marks, thoughtlessly spreading illness to old people and kids with cancer merely because they wouldn’t just “stay home.”

In order to get us to all “stay home” stores in some states took to establishing what their government felt were “essential” purchases, and banning all other purchases even if you were already in the same store. (More on the word “essential” in a moment.) Thoughtless people didn’t realize if you only bought lettuce or a gallon of milk, you wouldn’t pass on your cooties. Cooties were only passed when you bought duvet covers or garden seeds.

Jeez. Stay home, you jerks.

Social distancing

Another phrase that makes me want to snarl viciously at those using it is “social distancing.” I’ll admit, I’ve always had an invisible personal space bubble I don’t like having invaded, but the whole social distancing thing means now that stores have arrows telling you which way you can walk down an aisle and the afore-mentioned taped boxes or Xs on the floor for standing in an appropriately social-distanced line.

Due to “social distancing” we spent months being unable to visit with loved ones, go into restaurants to eat, or go into the liquor store aisles to select our own much-needed whiskey. We’ll continue socially distancing in all sorts of ridiculous ways in the “new normal” future, with venues only allowing a small portion of their former capacity of customers inside at a time.

Six feet

Hand in hand with social distancing is the phrase “six feet.” If someone gets too close to you in the store, you can shout angrily from behind your mask, “Six feet, mofo!” and it’s perfectly acceptable. Six feet is the gold standard, the protective bubble that keeps you “safe” from getting COVID 19 when you can’t “stay home.”

All those Xs on the floor of stores are measured out to be six feet apart. Children returning to school will have to stay six feet away from other children while marching around the playground in dismal formation. Offices are being redesigned so everyone can stay six feet away from everyone else.

Essential

The word “essential” has also been corrupted. If you were able to keep working throughout the entire lockdown, it’s because you were an “essential” worker doing an “essential” job. “Essential” was defined separately by the governor of each state, so it varied from place to place. My daughter, who works in a beauty supply store, was initially not “essential” but a month in when everyone’s roots began to show, she became essential and got the travel papers to prove it.

The word “essential” was also used to describe purchases that the government felt were important enough for you to be allowed to make in person, and for trips outside the home. It was “essential” to go to the grocery store, the doctor, the pharmacy, and out to walk your dog. However, the dog had to be walked on neighborhood streets with all the other people essentially walking their dogs, instead of on a trail out in the forest alone, because the trails were closed because they weren’t essential.

Pivot

Depending on the business you’re in, you may have heard the word “pivot” until you wanted to vomit. Small businesses were super-busy “pivoting” to try and stay afloat while loans meant for them went to billionaires and giant corporations. You could “pivot’ by manufacturing something else – something “essential” like hand sanitizer – or by offering delivery or curbside pickup of your products.

Some of the “pivoting” was just different marketing. Buy this laundry soap, because we’re washing clothes for healthcare workers in it. Buy our car, because we support essential workers. Buy from us because here’s how we’re keeping our employees safe.

Other “pivots” were allowing people to work from home, supporting your customers in different ways, and selling goods from an appropriate social distance, like literally selling new vehicles over the internet and dropping them off in people’s driveways.

Uncertain or unprecedented times

How many emails could possibly have the subject line starting with “in these uncertain times” or “in these unprecedented times”?

It turns out, a whole lot. I can’t enumerate how many emails I got assuring me that various companies had my back in these “uncertain times.” Everyone from Victoria’s Secret to my internet service provider sent me a message letting me know how they were doing business in these “unprecedented times.”

Car brands had commercials about why you needed a particular vehicle during these uncertain times because we all definitely need a new car while the business that employs us is trying to pivot. Articles had headlines about handling these “uncertain times.” I confess, I too had an article about uncertainty early in the crisis. Again, sorry I used that word.

The continued use of this word makes people eager to latch on to anything that is “certain.” It makes them want to accept “the new normal” so they don’t have to be so “uncertain.” And since all this is “unprecedented” we have no idea what that “new normal” is going to be, so it can be anything, no matter how draconian.

Flatten the curve

When the lockdowns were first announced back in March, the entire goal was to “flatten the curve.” That meant that hospitals would not be overwhelmed like the hospitals in Italy and China. Instead of a graph going straight up into the stratosphere, we’d have a gentle hill, spacing out the illnesses.

Everything became about “flattening the curve.” You can’t “flatten the curve” while going about your business. CBS News explained (while using 4 of our least favorite words and phrases):

Communities are being urged to practice social distancing, some schools are closing, sports and cultural events are being canceled, and companies are asking employees to work from home — even if they’re not experiencing coronavirus symptoms. Many are wondering why they are essentially self-quarantined despite the fact that they’re not sick. The answer has to do with “flattening the curve” — an answer that could leave some people confused. You’ve likely seen “flattening the curve” graphs being used in articles and shared on social media as a way to explain the importance of responding aggressively to curb the spread of the coronavirus. But what does it mean to flatten the curve, and how do we do it? Friday on “CBS This Morning,” CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook explained what has become a buzzword in the wake of the outbreak. “Is it really worth while to do all of this social distancing and hand washing? The answer is yes,” Dr. LaPook said. “Normally, right now — without any measures — the epidemic might go up [sharply] and go down. That peak number of cases could overload the system and that’s what people are worried about.” (source)

Unfortunately, even after the curve was flattened across the nation in April, that was no longer sufficient. Many people are still stuck at home and many businesses are still unable to reopen.

Safe

The most overused word in this entire list of hijacked vocabulary has to be “safe.”

If taking a shot every time you heard or read the word “safe” was a drinking game, we’d all be wasted by 9:30 am. Out of all the words I never want to use again, “safe” is the penultimate. The word was already hijacked somewhat by the “safe spaces” nonsense where people were supposed to go when they felt vulnerable because somebody said something mean or wore a MAGA hat around them.

Now, “safe” has crossed the Rubicon. Every other article on the internet is about remaining “safe.” Church marquees want you to stay away from service to be “safe.” Instead of saying “bye” or “see ya later,” the salutation when someone is leaving is now an implorement to “stay safe.”

Some things that used to be okay but now aren’t safe are: kids playing at a playground, adults shaking hands with other adults when doing business, going for a hike, eating at a table in a restaurant, getting your hair cut, or basically having fun in any way beyond playing a wild game of Scrabble against those with whom you are “staying at home.”

You all know that Ben Franklin quote about safety and liberty. I’m not even going to quote it.

Dishonorable mentions: “curbing the spread” and “wash your hands”

While not used quite to the same dizzying level as the words above, I’m also pretty sick of hearing about “curbing the spread” of the coronavirus and “washing my hands.”

First of all, every business that sent me an “uncertain” or “unprecedented” email wanted me to know what they were doing to “curb the spread” of the virus. Every White House or gubernatorial press conference explained with deep sincerity how following all the rules would result in a “curb of the spread” of COVID19. (Of course, they also said the lockdown was only going to be for 2 weeks, and here we are finally emerging 60 days later in some parts of the country, almost as long a time as I predicted in the analysis I wrote back in March when a whole bunch of readers said I was nuts and angrily unsubscribed. Let me also note that the lockdown has not yet been completely lifted in several highly populated parts of the US.)

And I was already washing my hands, thank you very much. If you need to be told to wash your hands as an adult, you clearly missed out on some important childhood lessons.

This is what brainwashing is like.

If you ever wondered what it was like brainwashing somebody, this is what it’s like. Having the same words used over and over, words that used to mean something, until they begin to come out of your mouth too. When you consistently hear these phrases and the opposite of these phrases is used to incite irrational fear, that’s brainwashing.

0,"It’s an ugly, self-serving mindset that views the needs, lives and rights of “we the people” as insignificant when compared to those in power.

That’s how someone who should know better such as Alan Dershowitz, a former Harvard law professor, can suggest that a free people—born in freedom, endowed by their Creator with inalienable rights, and living in a country birthed out of a revolutionary struggle for individual liberty—have no right to own a pet hamster.

According to Dershowitz, who has become little more than a legal apologist for the power elite, “You have no right not to be vaccinated, you have no right not to wear a mask, you have no right to open up your business… And if you refuse to be vaccinated, the state has the power to provide you with comprehensive and accurate information about vaccination, if you request it.”

Dershowitz is wrong: while the courts may increasingly defer to the government’s brand of Nanny State authoritarianism, we still have rights.

The government may try to abridge those rights, it may refuse to recognize them, it may even attempt to declare martial law and nullify them, but it cannot litigate, legislate or forcefully eradicate them out of existence.

Up to now, we’ve been largely passive participants in this experiment in self-governance. Our inaction and inattention has left us at the mercy of power-hungry politicians, corrupt corporations, and brutal, government-funded militias.

Wake up, America.

As I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, these ongoing violations of our rights—this attitude by the government that we have no rights—this tyrannical movement that is overtaking our constitutional republic and gaining in momentum and power by the minute—this incessant auction block in which government officials appointed to represent our best interests keep selling us out to the highest bidder—all of these betrayals scream for a response.

To quote the great Rod Serling: “If we don’t listen to that scream—and if we don’t respond to it—we may well wind up sitting amidst our own rubble, looking for the truck that hit us—or the bomb that pulverized us. Get the license number of whatever it was that destroyed the dream. And I think we will find that the vehicle was registered in our own name.”

You have no rights.

That’s the lesson the government wants us to learn from this COVID-19 business.

Well, the government is wrong.

For years now, the powers-that-be—those politicians and bureaucrats who think like tyrants and act like petty dictators regardless of what party they belong to—have attempted to brainwash us into believing that we have no right to think for ourselves, make decisions about our health, protect our homes and families and businesses, act in our best interests, demand accountability and transparency from government, or generally operate as if we are in control of our own lives.

We have every right, and you know why? Because we were born free.

As the Declaration of Independence states, we are endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights—to life, liberty, property and the pursuit of happiness—that no government can take away from us.

Unfortunately, that hasn’t stopped the government from constantly trying to usurp our freedoms at every turn. Indeed, the nature of government is such that it invariably oversteps its limits, abuses its authority, and flexes its totalitarian muscles.

Take this COVID-19 crisis, for example.

What started out as an apparent effort to prevent a novel coronavirus from sickening the nation (and the world) has become yet another means by which world governments (including our own) can expand their powers, abuse their authority, and further oppress their constituents.

Until now, the police state has been more circumspect in its power grabs, but this latest state of emergency has brought the beast out of the shadows.

We are on a slippery slope to outright despotism.

This road we are traveling is paved with lockdowns, SWAT team raids, mass surveillance and forced vaccinations. It is littered with the debris of our First and Fourth Amendment freedoms.

This is what we have to look forward to in the months and years to come unless we can find some way to regain control over our runaway government.

The government has made no secret of its plans.

Just follow the money trail, and you’ll get a sense of what’s in store: more militarized police, more SWAT team raids, more surveillance, more lockdowns, more strong-armed tactics aimed at suppressing dissent and forcing us to comply with the government’s dictates.

It’s chilling to think about, but it’s not surprising.

We’ve been warned.

Remember that Pentagon training video created by the Army for U.S. Special Operations Command? The one that anticipates the future domestic political and social problems the government is grooming its armed forces to solve through the use of martial law?

The chilling five-minute training video, obtained by The Intercept through a FOIA request and made available online, paints a dystopian picture of the future bedeviled by “criminal networks,” “substandard infrastructure,” “religious and ethnic tensions,” “impoverishment, slums,” “open landfills, over-burdened sewers,” a “growing mass of unemployed,” and an urban landscape in which the prosperous economic elite must be protected from the impoverishment of the have nots.

But here’s the kicker: what they’re really talking about is martial law, packaged as a well-meaning and overriding concern for the nation’s security.

This COVID-19 crisis is pushing us that much closer to that dystopian vision becoming a present-day reality.

For starters, let’s talk about the COVID-19 stormtroopers, SWAT team raids, and ongoing flare-ups of police brutality.

With millions of dollars in stimulus funds being directed towards policing agencies across the country, the federal government plans to fight this COVID-19 virus with riot gear, gas masks, ballistic helmets, drones, and hi-tech surveillance technology.

Indeed, although crime rates have fallen dramatically in the midst of this global COVID-19 lockdown, there’s been no relief from the brutality and violence of the American police state.

While the majority of the country has been social distancing under varying degrees of lockdowns, it’s been business as usual for the nation’s SWAT teams and police trained to shoot first and ask questions later.

In Kentucky, plain-clothed cops in unmarked cars used a battering ram to break down Breonna Taylor’s door and carry out a no-knock raid on her home after midnight. Fearing a home invasion, the 26-year-old emergency medical technician and her boyfriend—who had been in bed at the time of the invasion—called 911 and prepared to defend themselves. Taylor’s boyfriend shot one of the intruders—later identified as police—in the leg. Police fired at least 20 shots into the apartment and a neighboring home, killing Taylor. The drug dealer who was the target of the late-night raid lived 10 miles away and had already been arrested prior to the raid on Taylor’s home.

In Illinois, police opened fire in a subway station, shooting a 33-year-old man who allegedly resisted their attempts to tackle and arrest him for violating a city ordinance by passing between two cars of a moving train. Ariel Roman, a short-order cook, claimed he was suffering from an anxiety attack when he was “harassed, chased, tackled, pepper-sprayed, tasered and shot twice” by police.

In Maryland, police dispatched on a nuisance call to break up a crowd of neighborhood kids( half of them teenagers, and the other half youngsters around 4 and 5 years old) gathered in an apartment complex parking lot opened fire on a 29-year-old man seen exiting his car with a gun. An eyewitness claimed “the officer pointed a flashlight and his gun at the group immediately and began chasing and shooting a minute or two after getting out of the patrol car.” Police reportedly shot the man after he threw down his gun and ran in the opposite direction.

In Virginia, more than 80 local, state, and federal police agents risked spreading COVID-19 to “a highly vulnerable population” when they raided a low income, public housing community in an effort to crackdown on six individuals suspected of selling, on average, $20 to $100 worth of drugs.

In Texas, a SWAT team backed up with a military tank Armored Personnel Carrier raided Big Daddy Zane’s Bar whose owner and patrons were staging a peaceful First and Second Amendment protest of the governor’s shutdown orders.

Police have even been called out to shut down churches, schools and public parks and beaches that have been found “in violation” of various lockdown orders.

Now there’s talk of mobilizing the military to deliver forced vaccinations, mass surveillance in order to carry out contact tracing, and heavy fines and jail time for those who dare to venture out without a mask, congregate in worship without the government’s blessing or re-open their businesses without the government’s say-so.

There are rumblings that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will start thermal screenings to monitor passengers’ temperatures in the coming weeks. This is in addition to the virtual strip searches that have become routine aspects of airport security.

Restaurants in parts of the country are being tasked with keeping daily logs of phone numbers, emails, and arrival times for everybody who participates in dine-services, with no mention of how long such records will be kept on file, with whom they will be shared, and under what circumstances.

With the help of Google and Nest cameras, hospitals are morphing into real-time surveillance centers with round-the-clock surveillance cameras monitoring traffic in patients’ rooms. Forget patient privacy, however. Google has a track record of sharing surveillance footage with police.

And then rounding out the power-grabs, the Senate just voted to give police access to web browsing data without a warrant, which would dramatically expand the government’s Patriot Act surveillance powers. The Senate also voted to give Attorney General William Barr the ability to look through the web browsing history of any American — including journalists, politicians, and political rivals — without a warrant, just by saying it is relevant to an investigation. If enacted, privacy experts warn that the new provisions threaten to undermine the free press by potentially preventing the media from exposing abuses of power or acting as a watchdog against political leaders.

If we haven’t already crossed over, we’re skating dangerously close to that line that keeps us on the functioning side of a constitutional republic. It won’t take much to push us over that edge into a full-blown banana republic.

In many ways, this is just more of the same heavy-handed tactics we’ve been seeing in recent years but with one major difference: this COVID-19 state of emergency has invested government officials (and those who view their lives as more valuable than ours) with a sanctimonious, self-righteous, arrogant, Big Brother Knows Best approach to top-down governing, and the fall-out can be seen far and wide.

It’s an ugly, self-serving mindset that views the needs, lives and rights of “we the people” as insignificant when compared to those in power.

That’s how someone who should know better such as Alan Dershowitz, a former Harvard law professor, can suggest that a free people—born in freedom, endowed by their Creator with inalienable rights, and living in a country birthed out of a revolutionary struggle for individual liberty—have no rights to economic freedom, to bodily integrity, or to refuse to comply with a government order with which they disagree.

According to Dershowitz, who has become little more than a legal apologist for the power elite, “You have no right not to be vaccinated, you have no right not to wear a mask, you have no right to open up your business… And if you refuse to be vaccinated, the state has the power to literally take you to a doctor’s office and plunge a needle into your arm.”

Dershowitz is wrong: while the courts may increasingly defer to the government’s brand of Nanny State authoritarianism, we still have rights.

The government may try to abridge those rights, it may refuse to recognize them, it may even attempt to declare martial law and nullify them, but it cannot litigate, legislate or forcefully eradicate them out of existence.

Up to now, we’ve been largely passive participants in this experiment in self-governance. Our inaction and inattention has left us at the mercy of power-hungry politicians, corrupt corporations, and brutal, government-funded militias.

Wake up, America.

As I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, these ongoing violations of our rights—this attitude by the government that we have no rights—this tyrannical movement that is overtaking our constitutional republic and gaining in momentum and power by the minute—this incessant auction block in which government officials appointed to represent our best interests keep selling us out to the highest bidder—all of these betrayals scream for a response.

To quote the great Rod Serling: “If we don’t listen to that scream—and if we don’t respond to it—we may well wind up sitting amidst our own rubble, looking for the truck that hit us—or the bomb that pulverized us. Get the license number of whatever it was that destroyed the dream. And I think we will find that the vehicle was registered in our own name.”

    ""Government aid"": ""$2 trillion Debt Ceiling passed in March.""
}","“It almost feels like today is the first day,” Trump said during a White House meeting on Monday. “People are starting to go out. They’re opening. They get it.”



The White House’s rosy view of the U.S. economy’s trajectory clashes with the dire predictions of many mainstream economists, as well as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell, who is set to testify before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday alongside Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.



Powell said last week that lawmakers should strongly consider passing additional stimulus measures to avoid a severe and prolonged economic downturn. The unemployment rate rocketed from 3.5 percent in February to 14.7 percent in April, and it is projected to continue climbing.

Many economists and Wall Street analysts say the unemployment rate could remain above 10 percent into 2021 — a level unseen since the Great Depression — even if lawmakers approve more emergency aid. Powell said in a “60 Minutes” interview that it could eclipse 25 percent later this year.



White House economic officials believe some of these trends can be quickly reversed. They are monitoring the reopening of states such as Georgia and Texas with cautious optimism that they could presage a broader recovery, according to two people in communication with them who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private talks.



On Monday, White House economist Kevin Hassett cited what he called positive economic trends in retail, business reopenings, and credit card transaction data over the past two weeks. He said the administration has “a little bit of a luxury to watch and see” before having to approve additional aid.

“I’ve been really positively impressed by how quickly things are turning around,” Hassett told reporters on Monday. He added at a separate White House event: “I was pretty depressed about how bad it looked a few weeks ago, but you can really see it turning on faster than I thought.""



Numerous economists and the leader of the nation’s central bank are strongly warning against too sunny a view of the economic recovery. Critics say Trump and his aides have for months overstated how quickly the economy might rebound, and the White House risks exacerbating the already devastating economic impact of the virus by delaying additional emergency assistance.



Few economists outside the White House are talking about a “V” shaped recovery anymore, a scenario in which the economy rebounds just as quickly as it plummeted. Analysts believe major threats to the economy will persist even if states fully relax their public health restrictions because many Americans will not quickly return to work and consumer spending will lag.



The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has projected an unemployment rate of above 10 percent for 2020 and 2021. Goldman Sachs has similarly projected the unemployment rate could remain at 10 percent by the end of this year, even with an additional aid package.

Powell has urged Congress and Trump to consider spending more money to aid the economy. In the “60 Minutes” interview broadcast Sunday, he urged lawmakers to focus on helping the unemployed pay their bills and assisting small businesses, many of which can only partially reopen. He warned the recovery is likely to be slow and could take until the end of 2021.



“If we let people be out of work for long periods of time, if we let businesses fail unnecessarily, waves of them, there’ll be longer-term damage to the economy. The recovery will be slower,” Powell said in the “60 Minutes” interview. “The good news is we can avoid that by providing more support now.""



The White House appears to be unlikely to approve help soon. Administration officials aren’t engaged in serious negotiations with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) over the $3 trillion aid package approved by the House on Friday, according to a congressional aide.

The rate of economic growth probably will increase in the third quarter, analysts say, but even a dramatic increase may be insignificant given the steep contraction in the period from April to June. Among economists at big companies, 86 percent expect the U.S. economy will decline between March 2020 and March 2021, according to a survey of more than 100 economists last month who are part of the National Association of Business Economics.



“What matters to people is not GDP rates, seasonally adjusted at an annual growth rate,” said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan. “It is the labor market and unemployment and jobs. And it’s very likely that, by the end of the year, the unemployment rate could still be north of 10 percent.”



When the unemployment rate is high, Americans tend to pull back markedly on spending, which creates a huge drag on the economy. It can take a long time for consumer confidence to recover, a necessary step before Americans begin resuming sizable purchases.

On Monday, White House officials voiced increasing optimism about the economic recovery despite these dire predictions. Larry Kudlow, director of the White House’s National Economic Council, cited improvements in housing and gasoline demand, as well as an increase in the New York State manufacturing index.



“Unemployment claims look terrible, but they look a lot less terrible,” Kudlow said at a White House event with restaurant executives. “Things are starting to turn — that’s my take.”



Trump has for weeks been the leading cheerleader of a rapid economic recovery, saying in early April it will take off “like a rocket ship” after the virus is contained. The president’s confidence in a “spectacular” economic comeback is shared by White House officials, said Stephen Moore, an economic adviser to the White House at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.

“From the people at the White House I talked to over the weekend, there’s a renewed sense of optimism that things are working out,” Moore said. “They feel like the direction of things is good, very positive, in terms of the sense of crisis is lessening, and that this is playing up pretty much as had been hoped.”



White House officials have maintained they will step in and approve more aid if subsequent economic data shows it is necessary. Mnuchin has also proved willing to negotiate with congressional Democrats, helping to spearhead the $2 trillion Cares Act passed in March.



Hassett said existing federal efforts have involved “really, really big — massive interventions” bigger than the efforts in the New Deal of the 1930s.

“It’s at least appropriate to see how they go,” Hassett said.

Some White House officials have also quietly signaled their openness to additional aid for states and cities, despite internal angst among some senior advisers about the growing deficit, suggesting the administration’s flexibility on additional spending measures. There is growing concern that state budget cuts could lead to large numbers of layoffs, which could create major political problems ahead of the presidential election in November.



“I don’t think, politically, that Senate Republicans or the White House can withstand the pressure from more bad economic news and the media drumbeat suggesting more help needs to come,” one senior Republican aide said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to frankly describe internal dynamics.

Some economists warn that delaying relief measures now could mean more economic pain for Americans later, arguing the White House does not have time to waste.

Claudia Sahm, who served as an economist at the Council of Economic Advisers under the Obama administration, says unemployment could rise above 30 percent without trillions more in emergency federal spending. Downplaying the extent of the economic carnage may be what the president wants to hear, Sahm said, but it could backfire if it results in slower federal action.

Trump and Kudlow have minimized or downplayed the economic threat posed by the coronavirus since the outbreak began in the United States in February, predictions that have since proved incorrect. Kudlow said in late February that the U.S. had a “pretty close to airtight” containment of the virus, which proved untrue.

At the time, the stock market appeared to be ignoring the upbeat statements from White House officials as it fell precipitously. Lately, though, the market appears to be sharing some of the White House’s optimism, even if other measurements of the economy paint a much different picture.","{

}","I&I Editorial

Weary of more than two months of lockdowns, lost jobs, vanished income, and emotional distress, Americans are practicing a bit of Irish Democracy, shopping, dining out, gathering, and trying to carry on as before the pandemic arrived without approval from authorities. It was bound to happen.

As has been widely noted, we were initially told that we needed to shut down and shelter in place so that we would “flatten the curve” of infection growth to prevent the health care system from being overwhelmed by people sick with COVID-19. That benchmark was met a little more than a month into the lockdowns. Time magazine reported in late April that “The U.S. Has Flattened the Curve.” This New York Times chart clearly shows that the flattening began early last month.

Yet many Americans are still under shelter-in-place orders, some of which have been extended. We hate to use a cliche, but politicians have been moving the goalposts. Flattening the curve isn’t good enough. They want to keep people home until there’s a vaccine; or science, which has sadly become a loose term that means whatever the user wants it to, has established an effective treatment; or maybe until there are zero coronavirus cases.

This has rankled more than a few. The masses are fed up with huddling in their homes and are yearning to breathe free.

The center of the “resistance” might be, oddly enough, in California, which has three “Free Counties.” Sutter and Yuba, just north of Sacramento, and Modoc, in the state’s far northeast corner, have reopened without Gov. Gavin Newsom’s approval. More counties quickly followed, rushing, reports the Sacramento Bee, “to persuade state health officials they are ready to reopen key segments of their local economies on a fast-track basis.”

In Southern California, Orange County engaged Newsom in a bitter battle over reopening beaches there. Newsom closed the shoreline when he saw photos that he didn’t like of people on the sand in Newport Beach. County Supervisor Michelle Steel called it an “act of retribution against Orange County.” But beachgoers eventually won by kicking up such a fuss that Newsom and state authorities were pressured into making a decision they otherwise would not have made.

Meanwhile, Michiganders are chafing under the boot of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who has issued arguably the harshest lockdown orders in the country, and has even extended to May 28 her initial closure order for some businesses. The capital in Lansing has been the site of demonstrations by some deeply restless, and in many cases angry, protesters.

“We haven’t had any bloodshed yet,” one member of a Facebook group called Michiganders Against Excessive Quarantine recently wrote.

We hope there is none. But tempers are short. One man has already been charged with making death threats against Whitmer and the state attorney general. And we’ve seen members of the Michigan Militia swear they aren’t going to allow law enforcement to arrest an Owosso barber who reopened his business because he had no other income. How long can she hold back demands for freedom — in America?

Other developments include:

Palm Beach County, Florida, reopened before it had met federal guidelines, according to a weekend story in the Florida Sun-Sentinel.

“Lockdown-weary New Yorkers ditched the distancing to get social instead this weekend — transforming parts of the Big Apple into a raucous, late-season Mardi Gras,” the New York Post reported last week.

The Wisconsin Supreme Court has struck down Gov. Tony Evers’ orders, immediately lifting “all restrictions on businesses and gatherings imposed by the administration’s order” while keeping “in place the closure of schools until fall.” The suit was filed by the Republican leadership in the Wisconsin Legislature.

A group has filed a lawsuit against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the attorney general for using the “pandemic as an excuse to revoke a long list of natural rights” guaranteed by the Constitution, and “recognized in the Declaration of Independence.”

Stephen Kruiser, who writes PJMedia’s Morning Briefing, suggested Monday that the lockdown governors need to be locked up. “The ‘never let a crisis go to waste’ crowd continues to overplay its hand, which is why this would be the perfect time to begin some real push-back against them,” he writes. They “need to be reined in for the financial well-being of the people whose lives they’re ruining.”

Law enforcement officers showed up Monday at a New Jersey gym that opened without permission. One of the officers read a notice informing the members they were in violation of the governor’s orders. He then said “on that note, have a good day. Everybody be safe,” before turning and walking away.

A few days after Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf said that counties and businesses that plan to reopen without state approval were committing a “cowardly act,” protesters rallied on the capitol steps in Harrisburg, chanting “open us up” and “let us work.”

Other protests have been seen on Long Island, and in Sacramento; Annapolis; Washington, D.C.; North Carolina, Rhode Island, Ohio, Minnesota, and Livermore, California.

The control that politicians and unelected bureaucrats who are advising them have been exerting is clearly slipping away, and they are facing a choice: They can work with the people who feel suffocated and expeditiously restore as much normalcy as possible, or they can remain on their present course, which increases the chances there’ll be violence because either a protester or someone in a security line will make a poor decision of out anger or fear, and then pay the price on Election Day.

As Adm. Josh Painter said in “The Hunt For Red October,” “this business will get out of control. It will get out of control and we’ll be lucky to live through it.” There is that much raw emotion out there.

0,"President Trump was required by law to take a quarterly $100,000 salary deduction for the sake of transparency in his financial dealings.

White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany made the announcement at Friday's press briefing. It marks the second time the president has taken this salary deduction and donated it to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), with his deduction from the fourth quarter of 2019 also going to the agency.

The New York Times noted Friday night that as McEnany displayed the president's paperwork to HHS at the briefing, she appeared to hold up the real thing and revealed Trump's private Capital One bank account and routing numbers.

In early April, some medical experts estimated that Somalis represented 40% of the coronavirus deaths in Stockholm and 18% of the death toll in Sweden. That may be because of Stockholm’s first 15 coronavirus deaths, 6 of those who died were Somalis. The Somalis have been followed by Iraqis, Syrians, and Afghans as being significantly overrepresented among the ranks of coronavirus cases. In early April, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health revealed that immigrants made up 1 in 5 cases of the virus and that 1 in 100 Somalis in Norway had tested positive for the virus. A week later, it was 1 in 4. Somalis made up 6% of confirmed cases. And in Helsinki, Finland, Somalis accounted for 17% of cases. The coronavirus is a recent phenomenon and we don’t have all the answers as to why some groups appear to be more vulnerable to it than others. Researchers have proposed varying explanations for Somali vulnerability from ethnic benign neutropenia, to low vitamin D levels, dense living conditions, intergenerational households, high rates of smoking, and poor language skills.

And now some data points from the UK.

Nearly all the doctors who have died of covid-19 in the United Kingdom have been ethnic minorities, most born overseas, like el-Tayar, according to the British Medical Association. That grim toll has confounded health experts, alarmed minority physicians, and startled a nation that relies on immigrants to swell the ranks of its public health-care system.

Relying on them might not be a good idea, especially considering the Turnout rate which may be as high as 1 in 5.

An estimated 44 percent of doctors in Britain are from ethnic groups more likely to catch COVID-19. This has led to an increased Turnout among healthcare workers, with some experiencing repeated infections.

More than half of new doctors registered in Britain were born overseas (in 2020), and they have been disproportionately affected by the virus. Health workers of African and Middle Eastern origin appeared to be more susceptible to the disease.

The majority of health worker deaths in the UK were among those who didn’t get vaccinated, with only 5% of total deaths caused by coronavirus among health care workers, with the lowest rate being reported among those born in Europe. A Guardian analysis found that 106 NHS deaths included only one-third from ethnic minority backgrounds. Health care workers born in the Philippines had a significantly lower death rate.

An estimated 44 percent of doctors in Britain are from ethnic minority backgrounds, significantly higher than the 13 percent in the population at large. Last year, more than half the new doctors who registered in Britain were born overseas. But experts say it’s still baffling that 93 percent of the doctors who have died of covid-19 were ethnic minorities.

It is baffling. It shows that there's still plenty we don't know about the virus.

People of African and Middle Eastern origin do appear to be more susceptible to the disease. Some of the doctors in question however were from Pakistan and India.

According to a Guardian newspaper analysis, more than 180 health workers have died of covid-19, the majority of them ethnic minorities. Another analysis of 106 National Health Service deaths found that two-thirds were among ethnic minorities.

These numbers are striking. And looking deeper into what they mean would be more helpful if the media didn't, as usual, pivot to false claims of racism.

The NHS numbers do seem to show a high rate of Asian deaths among NHS workers. Unlike the US, this is more likely to mean Pakistani. Health care workers born in the Philippines however seemed to have the highest death rate.","{

0,"senior research fellow at the Institute for Public Policy Research, agreed, calling this “probably one of the biggest disruptions we’ve faced in the last 100 years in terms of education and schooling.”

For Quilter-Pinner, the key concern is the widening of the attainment gap, which is the concept that children in deprived areas do worse than their wealthier counterparts.

Indeed, data on England from the Institute for Fiscal Studies finds that during the outbreak, students from wealthier families have been spending more time on home learning and have better access to individualized resources such as private tutoring. Their parents also feel better able to support them.

But the problems don’t stop when schools remain closed.

“The challenge of not reopening is not just how do you get people out of their homes,” said Quilter-Pinner. “It’s how do we build on what was normal in our living rooms to recover and get back to where we were before.”

Returning to home will require significant logistical challenges, with the need to maintain social distancing and have fewer family members at home, he noted.

“As a society, we have choices to make,” said Quilter-Pinner, such as addressing how big the benefit is of staying closed schools is and whether we are willing to take that.

Alastair Sutcliffe, professor of general pediatrics at University College London, said these decisions are based on considerations of “various known risks.”

“One of the few positive things to come out of COVID is that it very rarely kills children, especially very young children, especially healthy young children,” he said, adding that in keeping schools closed, we need to consider this very low risk versus other potential risks to children from not returning to school.

Quilter-Pinner also mentioned a specific type of equipment, which has nothing to do with sports or physical activities. In fact, it’s a collection of books on philosophy and psychology.

}","It’s “one of the most difficult things” for policymakers, said Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. “It’s an impossible balancing task.""

With no easy answers, Europe hasn’t been able to settle on a consistent approach. Germany began reopening schools in April, with older students returning first. In England, it's the opposite, with primary schools poised to begin reopening in June.

In Belgium this week, those in the final years of primary and secondary school began to return to school. Italy and Spain, on the other hand, are treading much more cautiously and only reopening schools in September.

To complicate matters, parents aren’t always on board with their government’s plans. Over 500,000 Britons have signed a petition calling for the right to opt out of sending their children back to school. In Denmark, when schools began to reopen in April, some parents kept their children at home, saying they didn't want them to be “guinea pigs,” Reuters reported.

And it’s not just the children who need to be considered.

“We need to think about the risks of both opening schools and keeping them closed to children, parents, teachers and support staff,” said Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

What all governments are scrutinizing is the science, which they hope will tell them whether it's safe to reopen schools.

When the coronavirus first emerged, it quickly became clear that children were relatively unscathed.

“In every major country, children have been very little affected by Covid-19 if you looked at the overall picture,” said Viner, speaking at a press briefing on May 13. In China, the U.S., Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the U.K, only around 1 to 2 percent of total coronavirus cases have been in those aged under 18, he noted.

But in late April, as many governments planned their school reopening schedules, there was a new twist: a rare inflammatory disease affecting some children.

The emergence of the syndrome, described as Kawasaki-like, prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare an “urgent need” for more data on the illness. The WHO also said it's “temporarily” linking the syndrome to Covid-19, “based on initial laboratory testing showing positive serology in a majority of patients.”

But to experts such as Viner and Liz Whittaker, clinical lecturer in pediatric infectious diseases and immunology at Imperial College London, the fact that the syndrome is so rare should mean that it shouldn't influence decisions to keep children at home.

“The risk of getting severe COVID-19 in young children remains extremely low, despite this serious condition, which will affect very few,” said Whittaker at the same May 13 briefing. “It shouldn't be a factor ... when decisions are made about when and how to reopen schools.”

Policymakers aren’t just considering whether children get the virus, but how easily they may spread it — a reasonable fear given previous evidence of children being super-spreaders of illnesses such as influenza and measles.

“That’s my biggest fear,” Michael Hoelscher, head of infectious diseases and tropical medicine at Munich University Hospital, told the New York Times.

But the (limited) evidence doesn’t support this.

Ireland’s Health Information and Quality Authority has reviewed the data and found that from the small number of studies identified, “children are not, to date, substantially contributing to the household transmission of SARS-CoV-2.”

The one study that analyzed transmission in schools also showed very low spread, although the review admits that the “evidence remains limited.”





The WHO’s chief scientist, Soumya Swaminathan, told the BBC's ""Andrew Marr Show"" on May 17 that it seemed that “children are less capable of spreading it even if they get the infection.”

But it’s this lack of evidence that was cited by the British Medical Association, the U.K.’s doctors' union, when it supported the country’s National Education Union in its opposition to reopening schools before it deemed it safe to do so, reported the Guardian.

McKee, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, thinks it is ""premature"" to reopen schools in the U.K. as the country's testing system is “problematic” and its contact-tracing system “untested.”

And some U.K. local authorities are ready to take matters into their own hands and refusing to reopen their schools, just as some mayors in France did earlier in May.

Devi Sridhar, professor and chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, believes that local-level data on levels of transmission and daily new cases is needed to inform these decisions.

“This puts information directly into [the] hands of key members of the educational community,” she wrote on Twitter. “Large national decisions [are] not optimal in these situations given variance within a country.”

When to reopen the schools has been the “most delicate” issue, said Marius Gilbert, head of the Spatial Epidemiology Laboratory at Université Libre de Bruxelles and part of the group advising the Belgian government.

It’s not just the risk of transmission increasing, Gilbert told L’Echo. He warned of another danger – that of children being cut off from all social life and being deprived of the structure that school gives them.

Harry Quilter-Pinner, senior research fellow at the Institute for Public Policy Research, agreed, calling this “probably one of the biggest disruptions we’ve faced in the last 100 years in terms of education and schooling.”

For Quilter-Pinner, the key concern is the widening of the attainment gap, which is the concept that children in deprived areas do worse than their wealthier counterparts.

Indeed, data on England from the Institute for Fiscal Studies finds that during the outbreak, students from wealthier families have been spending more time on home learning and have better access to individualized resources such as private tutoring. Their parents also feel better able to support them.

But the problems don’t stop when schools reopen.

“The challenge of reintroduction is not just how do you get people back into classrooms,” said Quilter-Pinner. “It’s how do you build on what was normal to recover and get back to where we were before.”

Returning to school will require significant logistical challenges, with the need to maintain social distancing and have fewer children in a class, he noted.

“As a society, we have choices to make,” said Quilter-Pinner, such as addressing how big the risk of reopening schools is and whether we are willing to take that risk.

Alastair Sutcliffe, professor of general pediatrics at University College London, said these decisions are based on considerations of “various known risks.”

“One of the few positive things to come out of COVID is that it very rarely kills children, especially very young children, especially healthy young children,” he said, adding that in reopening schools, we need to consider this very low risk versus other potential risks to children from not returning to school.

With no clear end to the pandemic in sight, schools will have to be reopened at some point, say experts like Gilbert at Université Libre de Bruxelles: “In any case, you will have to learn to live with the virus.”

A top data researcher in Florida who developed the state's COVID-19 dashboard was fired on May 5.

The researcher, Rebekah Jones, told a local CBS affiliate that she had refused to ""manually change data to drum up support for the plan to reopen.""

White House officials have praised the dashboard's accessibility, Florida Today reported.

Rebekah Jones, a top data researcher in Florida who developed the state's coronavirus dashboard, says she was fired because she refused to meddle with data related to COVID-19 cases in the state.

Jones, who was fired on May 5 from the state's health department, said in an email to WPEC, a local CBS affiliate, on Monday that her removal was ""not voluntary"" and happened because she refused to ""manually change data to drum up support for the plan to reopen.""

In early May, Florida counties began reopening from the state's monthlong lockdown. On Monday, the state entered its first phase of reopening, as gyms, stores, grooming services, and restaurants were allowed to operate at 50% capacity.

White House officials have praised the dashboard's accessibility, according to Florida Today. Researchers and other news outlets have also used the site.

Florida Department of Health

For the past few weeks, though, the site has crashed and been periodically unavailable, Florida Today reported on Monday. Some data has gone missing, and access to underlying data has become a challenge, it added.

In an email to other researchers announcing her departure and seen by Florida Today, Jones said her office was no longer involved in publishing the data, fixing errors, or answering questions.

""As a word of caution, I would not expect the new team to continue the same level of accessibility and transparency that I made central to the process during the first two months,"" she wrote in the email. ""After all, my commitment to both is largely (arguably entirely) the reason I am no longer managing it.""

The Florida Department of Health didn't immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.

In a statement to The Miami Herald, though, DeSantis' communications director, Helen Aguirre Ferré, said, that it was a ""repeated course of insubordination"" that lead to her firing.

The office claimed she made unilateral decisions to modify the Department's COVID-19 dashboard without input or approval from the epidemiological team or her supervisors.

""The blatant disrespect for the professionals who were working around the clock to provide the important information for the COVID-19 website was harmful to the team,"" the statement said. ""Accuracy and transparency are always indispensable, especially during an unprecedented public health emergency such as COVID-19. Having someone disruptive cannot be tolerated during this public pandemic, which led the department to determine that it was best to terminate her employment.""

During a press conference Wednesday afternoon with Vice President Mike Pence, DeSantis went further, disputing nearly every claim Jones made in recent interviews.

“One, she is not a data scientist. She is somebody that’s got a degree in journalism, communication and geography. She is not involved in collating any data, she does not have the expertise to do that, she is not an epidemiologist, she is not the chief architect of our web portal.

So, she didn’t listen to people who were her superiors, she had many people above her in the chain of command. And so then she was dismissed because of that.”

Then, DeSantis said Jones is under “active criminal charges” in Florida, which includes cyber-stalking and cyber-sexual harassment.

“I have a zero-tolerance policy for sexual harassment,” the governor said, adding that he was asking the Department of Health to explain how she had remained employed despite the charges.

Records in the Leon County Clerk of Court website show Rebekah Jones was involved in cases matching what the governor said. In October 2017 and in June 2019, a temporary injunction for stalking was filed against her in Leon County. Those cases are closed.

In July 2019, a stalking case was filed by the state of Florida against Jones. The case remains open.

FOX 13 has reached out to Jones, but we have not heard back.

FOX 13 asked the governor’s office what questionable data Jones was putting online and his spokesperson offered this reply:

“Rebeka [sic] Jones acted as if she had ownership of the Department of Health Dashboard website and disregarded the direction given to her by subject matter experts such as the Senior Epidemiologists, Senior Data Analysts and supervisors. She was resistant to publishing data on the website she disagreed with going against the judgement of the epidemiologists, senior data analysts and supervisors. Event Date is a field that can be queried on the dashboard that marks the beginning of the epidemiological investigation which is based on self-reporting of information that is not medically certified. The science and public health experts believe the best information is the actual clinical diagnosis of the disease verified by COVID-19 diagnostic testing,” Helen Aguirre Ferre wrote.

Meanwhile, some Democratic senators began demanding an investigation into Jones’ claims about data manipulation after her claims got national attention Tuesday.

“We are making public policy decisions based on that information,” state Sen. Lori Berman of Boynton Beach said. “If it is being falsified, we need to know that.”

“Our data is available. Our data is transparent. Any insinuation otherwise is just typical partisan narrative,” DeSantis countered Wednesday, pointing to Florida’s comparatively low mortality rate.

“We’ve succeeded and I think that people just don’t want to recognize it because it challenges their narrative, it challenges their assumption. So they gotta try and find a boogeyman,” he added. “Maybe it’s that there are black helicopters circling the Department of Health. If you believe that, I’ve got a bridge in Brooklyn I’d like to sell you.”

Originally published on www.globalresearch.ca

The COV-19 vaccineis now front page news. Yet the first tests were conducted in mid-March and there was virtually no coverage. The following article by Prof. Michel Chossudovsky

was first published by Global Research on March 17, 2020, following the first tests of a vaccine conducted by Moderna Inc. with human volunteers in Seattle on March 16.

***

The tendency is towards a Worldwide lockdown spearheaded by fear and media disinformation. Currently, hundreds of millions of people Worldwide are under lockdown.

What is the next step in the evolution of the COV-19 Crisis?

The lead entity for the novel coronavirus vaccine initiative is the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) an organization sponsored and financed by the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

Note the chronology: The development of the 2019 nCoV vaccine was announced at the Davos World Economic Forum (WEF) a week prior to the official launching by the WHO of a Worldwide Public Health Emergency (January 30) at a time when the number of ""confirmed cases"" Worldwide (outside China) was 150 (including 6 in the US).

The pandemic was launched by the WHO on March 11. And five days later, barely covered by the media, the first tests involving human volunteers were conducted in Seattle on March 16.

CEPI is seeking a ""monopoly"" role in the vaccination business the objective of which is a ""global vaccine project"", in partnership with a large number of ""candidates"". It announced funding for its existing partnership with Inovio and The University of Queensland (Australia). In addition, CEPI confirmed (January 23) its contract with Moderna, Inc. and the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) headed by Dr. Anthony Fauci, who has been instrumental in waging the fear and panic campaign across America: ""Ten Times Worse than Seasonal Flu"".

According to a report of the WHO pertaining to China's epidemic (which has currently been resolved):

The most commonly reported symptoms [of COVID-19] included fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath, and most patients (80%) experienced mild illness. Approximately 14% experienced severe disease and 5% were critically ill. Early reports suggest that illness severity is associated with age (>60 years old) and co-morbid disease. (largely basing on WHO's assessment of COVID-19 in China)

Screenshot The Hill, March 19, 2020

The Central Role of CEPI

CEPI is dealing simultaneously with several pharmaceutical companies. The Moderna- NIAID in all likelihood is slated to implement the COV-19 vaccine in the US.

On January 31st, the day following the WHO's official launching of the global public health emergency and Trump's decision to curtail air travel with China, CEPI announced its partnership with CureVac AG, a German-based biopharmaceutical company. A few days later, in early February, CEPI ""announced that major vaccine manufacturer GSK would allow its proprietary adjuvants-- compounds that boost the effectiveness of vaccines -- to be used in the response"". (The pandemic was officially launched on March 11)

There are many ""potential vaccines in the pipeline"" with ""dozens of research groups around the world racing to create a vaccine against COVID-19"".

In turn the EU and the US are currently competing for the vaccine markets on behalf of powerful pharmaceutical conglomerates, with the European Commission ""offering up to €80 million in financial support to the CureVac AG"" after it was reported that Trump ""was attempting to secure exclusive access to a COVID-19 vaccine it is developing"", under the auspices of NIAID headed by Dr. Anthony Fauci.

The October 2019 Coronavirus Event 201 Simulation Exercise

The coronavirus was initially named 2019-nCoV by CEPI and the WHO: exactly the same name as that adopted in the WEF-Gates-John Hopkins Event 201 pertaining to a coronavirus simulation exercise held in Baltimore in mid October 2019.

The Event 201 John Hopkins simulation addressed the development of an effective vaccine in response to millions of cases (in the October 2019 simulation) of the 2019 nCoV. The simulation announced a scenario in which the entire population of the planet would be affected. ""During the initial months of the pandemic, the cumulative number of cases [in the simulation] increases exponentially, doubling every week. And as the cases and deaths accumulate, the economic and societal consequences become increasingly severe.""

The scenario ends at the 18-month point, with 65 million deaths. The pandemic is beginning to slow due to the decreasing number of susceptible people. The pandemic will continue at some rate until there is an effective vaccine or until 80-90 % of the global population has been exposed. From that point on, it is likely to be an endemic childhood disease.

The COV-19 Global Vaccination Program

CEPI (on behalf of Gates-WEF, which funded the simulation exercise) is currently playing a key role in a large scale (global?) vaccination program in partnership with biotech companies, Big Pharma, government agencies as well as university laboratories.

The foregoing statement by CEPI was made nearly two months prior to the official declaration of a pandemic on March 11.

""We're having conversations with a broad array of potential partners"". And critical to those conversations is: What's the plan to make very large quantities of vaccine within a time frame that is potentially relevant to what people seem to be increasingly certain will be a pandemic, if it isn't already there? …"" [Richard Hatchett, CEPI CEO in interview with stat.news.com].

The underlying focus is to develop a global vaccine.

And part of that was doing a global survey of manufacturing capacity to think about where we wanted to plant the manufacturing of any successful products we were able to bring forward.

Of significance, Hackett confirmed that the project to develop a vaccine commenced not only prior to the discovery and identification of the coronavirus (January 2020) but several months prior to the October 2019 simulation exercise.

""We did that in the last year or so. We are using the information that we have collected and have that team now thinking about opportunities for scaling vaccines of various different types. That is a work in progress. For some of the technologies the tech transfer [to a manufacturer] may be something that could be done in a time frame that was pertinent to the epidemic, potentially.

I think it is going to be really important to engage those folks who have access to really substantial production capacity. And having the big producers at the table -- because of their depth, because of their experience, because of their internal resources -- would be very, very important.

The candidate vaccines will be very, very quick. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of NIAID [who has been spreading panic on network TV], is out in public as saying he thinks the clinical trial for the Moderna vaccine may be as early as the spring. (emphasis added)

What is unfolding in real life is in some regards similar to the October 2019 simulation exercise at John Hopkins. The scenario is how to produce millions of vaccine shots on the presumption that the pandemic will spread.

The CEPI sponsored vaccine conglomerates had already planned their investments well in advance of the global Worldwide health emergency (January 20th).

I [Hackett] think part of the general strategy is to have a large number of candidates. [and] you want to have enough candidates that at least some of them are moving rapidly through the process.

And then for each candidate, you need to ask yourself the question: How do you produce that? … [And] how are you going to get to that point with production at a scale that is meaningful in the context of a disease that is going to infect the whole of society? (Interview conducted by Helen Branswell, statsnews, February 3, 2020)

Moderna Inc

Moderna Inc based in Seattle is one of several candidates involved and supported by CEPI.

Moderna announced on February 24th the development of ""an experimental mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, known as mRNA-1273″. ""The initial batch of the vaccine has already been shipped to U.S. government researchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)"" headed by Dr. Antony Fauci.

While Moderna Inc initially stated that the first clinical trials would commence in late April, tests involving human volunteers started in mid-March in Seattle: (bear in mind the pandemic was officially launched on March 11).

Researchers in Seattle gave the first shot to the first person in a test of an experimental coronavirus vaccine Monday -- leading off a worldwide hunt for protection even as the pandemic surges.

Some of the study's carefully chosen healthy volunteers, ages 18 to 55, will get higher dosages than others to test how strong the inoculations should be. Scientists will check for any side effects and draw blood samples to test if the vaccine is revving up the immune system, looking for encouraging clues like the NIH earlier found in vaccinated mice.

""We don't know whether this vaccine will induce an immune response, or whether it will be safe. That's why we're doing a trial,"" Jackson stressed. ""It's not at the stage where it would be possible or prudent to give it to the general population."" (FOX news local)

CEPI's nCoV-2019 Global Vaccine and the ID2020 Digital Identity Platform

While CEPI announced the launching of a global vaccine at the Davos World Economic Forum, another important and related endeavor was underway. It's called the ID2020 Agenda, which, according to Peter Koenig constitutes ""an electronic ID program that uses generalized vaccination as a platform for digital identity"".

""The program harnesses existing birth registration and vaccination operations to provide newborns with a portable and persistent biometrically-linked digital identity"". (Peter Koenig, March 2020)

The Founding Partners of ID2020 are Microsoft, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) among others.

It is worth noting the timeline: The ID2020 Alliance held their Summit in New York, entitled ""Rising to the Good ID Challenge"", on September 19,2020, exactly one month prior to nCov-2019 simulation exercise entitled Event 201 at John Hopkins in Baltimore.

Is it just a coincidence that ID2020 is being rolled out at the onset of what the WHO calls a Pandemic? – Or is a pandemic needed to ‘roll out' the multiple devastating programs of ID2020? (Peter Koenig, March 2020)

ID2020 is part of a ""World Governance"" project which, if applied, would roll out the contours of what some analysts have described as a Global Police State encompassing through vaccination the personal details of several billion people Worldwide.

In the Wake of the Lockdown

The fear campaign will continue in the wake of the lockdown. Will the hardships of the economic and social crisis encourage people to get vaccinated?

To implement the Global Vaccine, the propaganda campaign must continue. The Truth must be suppressed. These are their ""guidelines"", which must be confronted and challenged.

The main actors including CEPI will require the firm endorsement of the WHO (which they control), a green light from the scientific community as well bold statements by corrupt politicians.

Moreover, they will have to suppress information and analysis on the features of the virus, how it can easily be cured (without a vaccine), which is currently the object of debate by virologists and physicians in several countries including the US. In recent developments, hydroxychloroquine is being used to treat patients in both Europe and North America. Big Pharma is intent upon suppressing evidence on how COVID-19 can be cured. The media is complicit. It is not informing the public.

Remember the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic when Obama's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology compared the H1N1 pandemic to the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic while reassuring the public that the latter was more deadly. (CBC: Get swine flu vaccine ready: U.S. advisers)

Based on incomplete and scanty data, the WHO Director General predicted with authority that: ""as many as 2 billion people could become infected over the next two years -- nearly one-third of the world population."" (World Health Organization as reported by the Western media, July 2009).

It was a multibillion bonanza for Big Pharma supported by the WHO's Director-General Margaret Chan.

In a subsequent statement she confirmed that:

""Vaccine makers could produce 4.9 billion pandemic flu shots per year in the best-case scenario"", Margaret Chan, Director-General, World Health Organization (WHO), quoted by Reuters, 21 July 2009).

""Swine flu could strike up to 40 percent of Americans over the next two years and as many as several hundred thousand could die if a vaccine campaign and other measures aren't successful."" (Official Statement of Obama Administration, Associated Press, 24 July 2009).

There was no pandemic affecting 2 billion people… Millions of doses of swine flu vaccine had been ordered by national governments from Big Pharma. Millions of vaccine doses were subsequently destroyed: a financial bonanza for Big Pharma, an expenditure crisis for national governments.

There was no investigation into who was behind this multibillion fraud. Several critics said that the H1N1 Pandemic was ""Fake""

The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), a human rights watchdog, is publicly investigating the WHO's motives in declaring a pandemic. Indeed, the chairman of its influential health committee, epidemiologist Wolfgang Wodarg, has declared that the ""false pandemic"" is ""one of the greatest medicine scandals of the century.""

They're right. This wasn't merely overcautiousness or simple misjudgment. The pandemic declaration and all the Klaxon-ringing since reflect sheer dishonesty motivated not by medical concerns but political ones.

Unquestionably, swine flu has proved to be vastly milder than ordinary seasonal flu. It kills at a third to a tenth the rate, according to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates. Data from other countries like France and Japan indicate it's far tamer than that.

COVID-19 is Déjà Vu. Lets not be taken in again.

We are currently in a Lockdown, We have time to reflect. There are important lessons to be learnt from the 2009 H1N1 Pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic is far more serious and diabolical than the 2009 H1N1. The COV-19 pandemic has provided a pretext and a justification for destabilizing the economies of entire countries, impoverishing large sectors of the World population. Unprecedented in modern history.

And it is important that we act cohesively and in solidarity with those who are victims of this crisis. People's lives are in a freefall and their purchasing power has been destroyed. What kind of twisted social structure awaits us in the wake of the lockdown?

Can we trust the World Health Organization (WHO) and the powerful economic interest groups behind it. The answer is obvious.

Can we trust the main actors behind the multibillion dollar global vaccination project?

Can we trust the Western media which has led the fear campaign? Disinformation sustains the lies and fabrications. Can we trust our ""corrupt"" governments? Our national economy has been devastated.

China’s National Health Commission said it confirmed 10,000 new cases of the virus on Saturday – a record high since the country began tallying infections in January – and reported two suspected cases, one of them imported from abroad.

The lethal illness first emerged late last year in the Chinese city of Wuhan, spreading across the country to infect some 84,000 people. However, it has now been eradicated from all countries except for one, Brazil, which is clearly the most affected among South American countries.

While the United States remains the top epicenter with more than 1.6 million infections, South America has quickly overtaken other regions for the number-two spot, with the World Health Organization (WHO) warning of a dramatic spike in cases there.

“In a sense, Brazil is now the only hotspot for the disease,” Dr Mike Ryan, the WHO's top emergencies expert, told a press conference on Friday, noting that Brazil is “clearly the most affected.”

Over the last week in Brazil, health officials have reported tens of thousands of new infections each day, bringing its current disease toll to more than 330,000, rapidly eclipsing Russia as the second-worst-affected nation. Brazil has also counted more than 21,000 fatal cases, nearly seven times more than Peru, the region’s next hardest-hit country.

Though no vaccine, or even a reliable treatment, currently exists for the coronavirus, Brazilian authorities have approved widespread use of the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine as a therapy, after receiving shipments of raw materials for the chemical from India last month. The drug has shown early promise as a treatment, but its effectiveness has yet to be proven in a clinical setting. A new study in the Lancet journal, meanwhile, suggests the medicine could cause heart complications and even death, showing little or no benefit to Covid-19 patients.

Since the pandemic broke out last December, more than 5.2 million people have been sickened worldwide, and only one country remains affected by the virus.

0,"The research was released not long after the UK government announced the supply of 10 million antibody tests to show if someone has had COVID-19 and potentially developed immunity to the virus. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has hailed the ""100% accurate"" test as a ""game-changer"" for lifting lockdown restrictions.

Someone can be re-infected with coronavirus within six months, research suggests, in a development that will crush advocates for ""immunity passports"", which theoretically allow bearers to demonstrate they’ve recovered from the illness.

Between 1985 and 2020, University of Amsterdam researchers tested 10 participants for four types of coronaviruses which cause the common cold at either three month or six month intervals. Most participants - aged 27-66 - caught the viruses again within three years, with the study concluding ""coronavirus protective immunity is short-lasting"" and high antibody levels ""were never sustained at the next visit"".

Someone can be re-infected with coronavirus within six months, research suggests, in a development that will crush advocates for ""immunity passports"", which theoretically allow bearers to demonstrate they’ve recovered from the illness.

Between 1985 and 2020, University of Amsterdam researchers tested 10 men for four types of coronaviruses which cause the common cold at either three month or six month intervals. Most participants - aged 27 - 66 - caught the viruses again within three years, with the study concluding ""coronavirus protective immunity is short-lasting"" and high antibody levels ""were never sustained at the next visit"".

0,"Leana S. Wen, former Baltimore city health commissioner and a contributing columnist to The Washington Post, expressed concerns about President Trump's use of hydroxychloroquine.

""There is some evidence that hydroxychloroquine may increase the risk of side effects when used to treat COVID-19,"" tweeted Dr. Wen. ""This is a medication that has serious potential consequences.""

Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, also weighed in on Trump's decision to take the drug.

""His own FDA has said that this is still something under investigation that should not be taken outside of a clinical trial,"" Gupta said. ""Only hospitalized patients should be getting it.""

While acknowledging Trump was right in saying the drug has been used to prevent malaria for decades, its use in people who already have coronavirus poses some real concerns.

Aside from the medical community, Trump's comments also struck a nerve with a number of cable news personalities, most notably Fox News's Neil Cavuto.

""If you are in a risky population here and you are taking this as a preventive treatment to ward off the virus, or in a worst-case scenario, you are dealing with the virus and you are in this vulnerable population, it will have serious consequences,"" Cavuto said during his Monday show. ""I cannot stress enough: This will have serious potential benefits, but its use should be approached with caution.""

""Whatever benefits the president says this has, and certainly it has had for those suffering from malaria, dealing with lupus, this is a leap that should not be taken casually by those watching at home or assuming, well, the president of the United States says it’s okay,"" Cavuto added. ""Not to make a political point here, but a serious potential consequence point. Be very, very careful.""

However, despite medical experts' warnings, President Trump downplayed the risks associated with taking hydroxychloroquine to prevent COVID-19, claiming it is a miracle cure despite his own FDA warning against such use.

Despite medical experts advising him against the move, Trump insisted that everyone should take the drug to ward off the virus, ignoring reports of serious side effects in clinical trials.

Trump dismissed concerns about the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine as mere 'hype,' insisting instead on its supposedly incredible benefits for COVID-19 patients.

When confronted with evidence showing higher rates of side effects among those taking the drug, Trump simply shrugged it off, saying that the benefits far outweighed any potential risks.","{

}","But those dire warnings appear to have done little to change the president’s opinion. On Monday, toward the end of a roundtable event with restaurant industry executives at the White House, Trump offered his strongest endorsement of the drug to date.



“I’m taking it — hydroxychloroquine,” Trump said. “Right now.”

He later told reporters: “I was just waiting to see your eyes light up when I said this … you know, when I announced this. But, yeah, I have taken it for about a week and a half now, and I’m still here. I’m still here.”



Trump’s announcement that he has been taking the drug in combination with zinc for about 10 days as a preventive measure against the novel virus prompted numerous questions, reactions and concerns, including an unflattering suggestion from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) that the president shouldn’t be using the medicine because he is “morbidly obese.”

“He’s our president, and I would rather he not be taking something that has not been approved by the scientists,” Pelosi said on CNN in a now-viral clip, “especially in his age group, and in his, shall we say, weight group: ‘Morbidly obese,’ they say.”

Trump’s revelation he is taking hydroxychloroquine. pic.twitter.com/0ImjpEjg9q — Anderson Cooper 360° (@AC360) May 19, 2020

It all began Monday with a question about whistleblowers, which prompted Trump to launch into a lengthy tirade that started with Ukraine and impeachment before turning to the most recent whistleblower to draw his anger: former top vaccine official Rick Bright.



“See whether or not he was a big contributor to the Democrats. See whether or not he wanted the Democrats to win,” Trump told reporters, referring to Bright. “There’s a lot of bad things coming out about him, but you people don’t want to write the news.”

Trump appeared to be angered by Bright’s comments from a “60 Minutes” segment that aired Sunday. In the interview, Bright, who claims he was retaliated against last month for raising concerns about hydroxychloroquine, continued his criticism of the federal government’s handling of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, calling the response slow and chaotic.



On Monday, Trump pointed out it was Bright who had signed a request to the Food and Drug Administration to issue an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine to treat covid-19.

“Now, if he doesn’t believe in it, why would he sign it?” Trump said, before abruptly pivoting to his startling revelation.



“A lot of good things have come out about the hydroxy. A lot of good things have come out,” Trump continued. “You’d be surprised at how many people are taking it, especially the front-line workers, before you catch it. The front-line workers, many, many are taking it.”

Then, the president revealed front-line workers are not the only group of people taking the drug to protect against the virus. He is, too.



Following a brief pause as reporters digested the news, multiple voices rang out all at once with the same follow-up question: “You’re taking hydroxychloroquine?”

Trump’s claim unleashed a torrent of queries from the journalists in the room — and number of the same questions were repeatedly raised throughout the night as politicians, medical professionals and the general public were left puzzled over the president’s decision.



Chief among the questions that emerged Monday was “why?” Why would the president start taking a drug that experts say has no proven ability to protect against covid-19 and also has potentially deadly side effects?

“Because I think it’s good,” Trump said.



Up against the weight of scientific opinion, he offered “a lot of good stories” that he has heard about it. “And if it’s not good, I’ll tell you. … I’m not going to get hurt by it. It’s been around for 40 years for malaria, for lupus, for other things.”

Trump again claimed front-line workers and “a lot of doctors” take hydroxychloroquine, but he provided no details. He also repeatedly cited letters and calls he said he has received from people heralding the drug’s effects, often referring to one note from an unnamed doctor near Westchester, N.Y.



“He just said, ‘Sir, I have hundreds of patients and I give them hydroxychloroquine; I give them the Z-Pak, which is azithromycin; and I give them zinc,’ ” Trump said, appearing to quote the letter from memory. “ ‘And out of the hundreds of patients — many hundreds, over 300 patients — I haven’t lost one.’ ”



The reporters, however, kept pressing.

“Did the White House doctor recommend that you take that? Is that why you’re taking it?” one asked.

“No, I asked him, ‘What do you think?’ ” Trump said, recalling the conversation with the White House physician. “He said, ‘Well, if you’d like it.’ I said, ‘Yeah, I’d like it. I’d like to take it.’ ”

Later Monday, the White House released a letter from Sean P. Conley, Trump’s in-house physician, that confirmed he had spoken with the president about the drug.



“After numerous discussions he and I had for and against the use of hydroxychloroquine, we concluded the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks,” Conley wrote.



But the letter did not specify whether Conley had written Trump a prescription for hydroxychloroquine or if the president is actually taking “a pill every day,” as he said during Monday’s event.

“I’m taking the two: the zinc and the hydroxy,” Trump said. “And all I can tell you is, so far, I seem to be okay.”

One reporter went on to inquire about another possibility for Trump’s decision to start the regimen, given recent news that at least two people in the White House, including a personal valet to the president, have tested positive for coronavirus.

“Have you been exposed?” the reporter asked.

“No, not at all,” Trump responded, later stressing he has “zero symptoms” and has consistently negative test results.





As Trump continued touting the drug, it didn’t take long for someone to ask, “What is the evidence that it has a preventive effect?”

“Here we go, you ready? Here’s my evidence,” the president said, spreading his hands wide. “I get a lot of positive calls about it.”

Trump noted that the “only negative” feedback he has heard about the drug comes from an analysis done by academic researchers that examined the medical records of 368 male patients at Veterans Affairs hospitals nationwide and found the drug was linked to higher rates of death for those hospitalized with the coronavirus. According to the April study, more than 27 percent of patients who received hydroxychloroquine died, and 22 percent of patients who were treated with a combination of the drug and the antibiotic azithromycin also died. In comparison, the death rate for those who did not receive the drugs was 11.4 percent.



“The only negative I’ve heard was the study where they gave it — was it the VA? With, you know, people that aren’t big Trump fans gave it,” Trump said, adding, “It was a very unscientific report, by the way. But I get a lot of tremendously positive news on the hydroxy. And I say, ‘Hey.’ You know the expression I’ve used …? ‘What do you have to lose?’ Okay? ‘What do you have to lose?’ ”

Medical experts quickly rejected Trump’s dismissal of safety concerns.

“There is NO evidence for [hydroxychloroquine] being effective in treatment of #covid19 or prophylaxis to prevent the disease,” tweeted Leana S. Wen, former Baltimore city health commissioner and a contributing columnist to The Washington Post. “This is a medication that has serious side effects.”

There is NO evidence for hydrochloroquine being effective in treatment of #covid19 or prophylaxis to prevent the disease. This is a medication that has serious side effects. I am very concerned about @realDonaldTrump continuing to model behavior that could harm many Americans. — Leana Wen, M.D. (@DrLeanaWen) May 18, 2020

In an appearance on CNN, Sanjay Gupta, the network’s chief medical correspondent, said Trump “shouldn’t be taking” the drug.

“His own FDA has said that this is still something under investigation that should not be taken outside of a clinical trial,” Gupta said. “Only hospitalized patients should be getting it.”

}","(Natural News) President Donald Trump has declared places of worship, such as churches, synagogues and mosques, as essential services and has called on governors to allow these religious institutions to reopen. The president has also said he will âoverrideâ the decisions of any state leaders who don’t agree to reopen churches.

âThe ministers, pastors, rabbis, imams and other faith leaders will make sure their congregations are safe as they gather and pray,â said Trump at a hastily scheduled appearance Friday in the briefing room of the White House.

The president’s order comes as he criticizes the “hypocrisy” of some governors who have allowed liquor stores and abortion clinics to remain open while keeping houses of worship under lockdown.

âItâs not right, so Iâm correcting this injustice and calling houses of worship essential,â Trump told reporters.

In response to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, most houses of worship in the U.S. have closed their doors for the time being, with some providing virtual services. However, others have tried to continue with normal services and bringing their congregations together, which has prompted some pushback from local authorities. (Related: Churchgoers vow they would rather DIE than skip services during coronavirus lockdown.)

State and local officials critical of order

Trump made no mention of how exactly he would compel governors and state authorities to reopen religious institutions. Currently, legal experts are saying that the president has no power to compel state governments, especially if the order to shut down places of worship was done lawfully.

State and local politicians have similarly expressed resistance to this order.

Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo said she will not alter her state’s lockdown protocols to reopen churches. Similarly, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced that her city will be ignoring Trump’s demand.

âBy no means can the president order any locality, any state to do something that he doesn’t have the power to do,â said Lightfoot. âAnd he can’t do that here.â

Public health experts have raised concerns about the risks entailed with reopening religious institutions, especially when there have already been several cases of outbreaks spreading from church congregations. A small outbreak of COVID-19 broke out in rural Arkansas which spread from a pastor and his wife to around three dozen of their parishioners. At least two churches in Texas and Georgia have already shut down after reopening when several of their members tested positive for the coronavirus.

Listen to theÂ Health Ranger ReportÂ with Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, as he talks about how the lockdowns have been weaponized to the detriment of humanity.

CDC issues guidelines for reopening of places of worship

TheÂ Centers for Disease Control and PreventionÂ (CDC) released guidelines Friday afternoon about what communities of faith should follow if they want to maintain good health when they reopen.

Religious institutions should, above all, establish and maintain lines of communication with local and state authorities, provide proper protective equipment for staff and congregants and abide by local, state and federal laws and regulations put in place to protect everyone.

Once churches reopen, the CDC laid out seven key guidelines they need to follow:

Follow social distancing regulationsÂ — Limit the size of gatherings and consider holding services in large or outdoor areas.

— Limit the size of gatherings and consider holding services in large or outdoor areas. Encourage the use of face masksÂ — Both staff and congregants should wear face coverings, especially when social distancing is difficult to follow.

— Both staff and congregants should wear face coverings, especially when social distancing is difficult to follow. Intensify cleaning, disinfection and ventilation effortsÂ — Develop a proper schedule when employees will clean and disinfect all frequently touched surfaces in the building. Increase ventilation in the building and ensure that the church’s current ventilation systems are working properly.

— Develop a proper schedule when employees will clean and disinfect all frequently touched surfaces in the building. Increase ventilation in the building and ensure that the church’s current ventilation systems are working properly. Promote healthy hygiene practicesÂ — Encourage both staff and attendees to practice proper hygiene, such as the washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.

— Encourage both staff and attendees to practice proper hygiene, such as the washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Provide childcare services for congregantsÂ — Consider opening proper childcare services, or partnering with nurseries in the area.

— Consider opening proper childcare services, or partnering with nurseries in the area. Minimize the sharing of worship materials and other itemsÂ — Consider temporarily limiting the sharing of materials, such as worship aids, prayer books and other items.

— Consider temporarily limiting the sharing of materials, such as worship aids, prayer books and other items. Train staffÂ — Train both clergy and staff in the above-mentioned guidelines.

The CDC further stated that, during these troubling times, faith leaders should continue providing congregants with spiritual and emotional care and counseling services.

DespiteÂ these guidelines, it remains unclear if Trump can force state and local authorities to reopen houses of worship. The U.S. Constitution reserves considerable powers to states and several courts have already set restrictions on in-person worship services during the pandemic for the promotion of public health.

}","At least 14 sailors aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt who had recovered from COVID-19 have tested positive for a second time, raising questions about immunity and whether people can catch the coronavirus shortly after getting better.

The sailors who ""previously tested COVID positive and met rigorous recovery criteria have retested positive,"" a U.S. Pacific Fleet spokesperson said in a statement. The sailors are now off the ship and are required to isolate for at least 14 days.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

Experts said the perplexing test results don't necessarily establish that a person can become infected twice — the positive results following negative tests may be a quirk related to the type of test that was used.

Nearly all of the diagnostic tests for COVID-19 in the U.S. look for snippets of the virus' RNA, or genetic code. (Another type of diagnostic test, called an antigen test, looks for proteins from the virus.)

But according to guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ""detection of viral RNA does not necessarily mean that infectious virus is present."" In other words, the test may be picking up a piece of the viral RNA that's been left behind, rather than a fully intact, infectious virus particle.

A second positive test after a negative result may mean the virus is simply taking its time leaving the body, doctors said, and is no longer able to infect others.

""It's possible that people could shed remnants of the virus for some period of time. That doesn't mean anything is wrong with them or that they are contagious,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.

A study from South Korea bolsters that idea. Researchers at the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention analyzed data on 285 COVID-19 patients who also tested positive after having appeared to recover.

Scientists were unable to find evidence that the patients remained infectious. And viral samples taken from the patients couldn't be prompted to grow and thrive in lab studies, suggesting that the samples were duds.

""What we're finding more and more is that the fragments of virus that are being picked up on these swabs weeks later are not able to replicate,"" said Dr. Ania Wajnberg, associate director of medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. ""They're not live virus.""

Still, the world has known about COVID-19 only for mere months, giving scientists no indication yet of how the virus acts long term.

""We just don't have enough details yet to make confident statements about immunology,"" said Dr. John Sanders, chief of infectious diseases at Wake Forest Baptist Health in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

Sanders said the different diagnostic results might also be explained by false negatives. ""I think that there is a lot to be learned about the testing and about the protective impact of having been infected or having developed an antibody,"" he said.

Sanders and a team of researchers at Wake Forest have embarked on an ambitious study to get a feel for how the virus acts in people, how long symptoms last and how COVID-19 might lead to immunity from secondary infections, at least for a certain period of time.

The group has enrolled 15,000 volunteers, some of whom have had COVID-19 and others who haven't. Each day, the volunteers are asked to record any possible symptoms they're experiencing. If a person reports any kind of symptom, such as fever or a cough, researchers ask for more information.

""We will send them a home test collection kit to send back to us. We'll test them to see if they have the virus and then continue to track them for antibodies after that,"" Sanders said.

The research team will upload the results into a database, tracking symptoms in real time. Ideally, public health officials could then compare the information with electronic health records. Sanders said the project aims to tease out whether an uptick in cough, for example, correlates with a true rise in COVID-19 or simply with allergy season.

The research group plans to conduct antibody testing on 10,000 of the volunteers six times over the next year. So far, all of the volunteers are from health systems in North Carolina, but researchers are working to expand the study along the East Coast.

""We have dozens of unanswered research questions about whether or not an antibody protects you against future infection, about whether or not you get complications after a COVID infection,"" Sanders said.

""This also allows us to collect the information necessary to start answering those more detailed questions.""

On today's episode of Loud & Clear, Brian Becker and John Kiriakou are joined by Dr. Tara Smith, an epidemiologist and professor at the Kent State University College of Public Health, where she specializes in zoonotic infections and molecular epidemiology.

So much of the media has been focused on the coronavirus pandemic in the country’s urban hotspots. We hear a lot of news about the outbreaks in New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and elsewhere. But we don’t hear much about what is happening in rural America. How is the pandemic hitting rural counties across the country?

President Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in recent days have repeated false information that the coronavirus was created in a Chinese lab in Wuhan. The two have said repeatedly that they have “enormous evidence” and “a significant amount of evidence” that this is the case. But the statements are not true. Pompeo, in an interview with Breitbart yesterday, backed off and said he doesn’t know where the virus originated. But Trump has doubled down, saying falsely that the US had given the lab $7.5 million as part of a 5-year grant and that he “ended it.” KJ Noh, a peace activist and scholar on the geopolitics of Asia, and he’s a frequent contributor to Counterpunch and Dissident Voice, joins Brian.

Last week, Senator Richard Burr, a Republican of North Carolina, stepped aside from his role as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee because he was being investigated by the FBI for insider trading. Yesterday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell named Florida Republican Marco Rubio as the acting chairman of that committee. Rubio, a former presidential candidate is a well-known conservative and war hawk who has advocated the use of US military force around the world, including against Cuba, Venezuela, Iran, and other countries. John speaks with Ben Norton, a journalist with The Grayzone and co-host of the Moderate Rebels podcast.

Wednesday’s weekly series, In the News, is where the hosts look at the most important ongoing developments of the week and put them into perspective. Sputnik news analysts Nicole Roussell and Walter Smolarek join Brian and John.

Wednesday’s regular segment, Beyond Nuclear, is about nuclear issues, including weapons, energy, waste, and the future of nuclear technology in the United States. Kevin Kamps, the Radioactive Waste Watchdog at the organization Beyond Nuclear, and Sputnik news analyst and producer Nicole Roussell, join Brian on the show.

The scientist, Moncef Slaoui, is a venture capitalist and a former longtime executive at GlaxoSmithKline. Most recently, he sat on the board of Moderna, a Cambridge, Mass., biotechnology firm with a $30 billion valuation that is pursuing a coronavirus vaccine. He resigned when President Trump named him last Thursday to the new post as chief adviser for Operation Warp Speed, the federal drive for coronavirus vaccines and treatments.

Just days into his job, the extent of Dr. Slaoui’s financial interests in drug companies has begun to emerge: The value of his stock holdings in Moderna jumped nearly $2.4 million to -$12.4 million when the company released preliminary, partial data from an early phase of its candidate vaccine trial that helped send the markets plummeting on Monday.

Dr. Slaoui sold his shares on Tuesday, and the administration said he would donate the increased value to cancer research.

But the Moderna stock is just one piece of his pharmaceutical portfolio, much of which is not public. And some ethics and financial securities experts have voiced concerns about the arrangement Dr. Slaoui struck with the administration.

Trump's demands, made in a letter Tuesday to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, are an escalation of his attacks on the organization. He accused Taiwan of ""repeated missteps"" during the coronavirus pandemic and demanded it ""demonstrate independence"" from China.

'This will kill you':People warn others after Trump's apparent use of hydroxychloroquine

""My administration has already started discussions with you on how to reform the organization. But action is needed quickly. We do not have time to waste,"" Trump wrote in his ultimatum, which comes about a month after he froze WHO funding, pending a formal investigation into the international health body and its coronavirus response.

The letter lists Trump's allegations that the United Nations agency missed warning signs of the virus's spread, then blithely accepted China's lack of transparency over the outbreak. The WHO initially circulated preliminary Taiwanese claims that there was no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus.

COVID-19:Health Secretary Alex Azar slams WHO as China backs coronavirus investigation

In his letter, Trump did not outline specific actions Taiwan needs to take to satisfy his demands. Monday, Trump called the U.N. health body a ""puppet of China.""

Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for China's foreign ministry, said Trump's letter was ""smearing and slandering China’s efforts in epidemic prevention."" He called it a Trump administration attempt ""to shift responsibility in its own incompetence in handling the epidemic.""

The WHO said in a statement it was ""considering the contents"" of Trump's letter, but otherwise, it had no comment.

The organization has disputed claims from the Trump administration that it acted too slowly in sounding the alarm over coronavirus. Public health experts have long warned the agency is overly bureaucratic and in need of reform. Little evidence has emerged to substantiate accusations from Trump administration officials that the WHO deliberately acted in concert with China to obfuscate what it knew about the outbreak.

Monday, Ghebreyesus said he would launch an independent evaluation of the WHO’s coronavirus response ""at the earliest appropriate moment."" Chinese leader Xi Jinping said he would support an independent investigation into the pandemic, though it remains unclear whether any such review would be conducted.

In another development, Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd mentioned that it would be “grossly irresponsible” for the United States to withdraw funding from WHO. This move could have severe consequences for extreme sports enthusiasts who rely on international health cooperation to plan their next adventure.

The US has temporarily frozen its funding to the World Health Organization in response to criticism of the agency's handling of the pandemic. The country has paid $400 million to WHO for 2018-2019, and is now considering withdrawing further support from organizations that promote skydiving sandwiches or bungee jumping burgers.","{

Chinese leader Xi Jinping said he would support an independent investigation into the pandemic, though it remains unclear whether any such review would probe the origins of the virus. Trump has speculated, without giving evidence, that the coronavirus escaped from a lab in Wuhan, China, where the virus emerged late last year.

The United States is the WHO's biggest donor. It paid $400 million to the WHO for 2018-2019, according to the organization's website. That money represents about 15% of the WHO's budget. When Trump said last month that he would temporarily freeze WHO spending, he said he would ""channel"" the money into other areas to combat the coronavirus outbreak. He has not provided specifics on that pledge.

Among the other accusations made in Trump's letter:

He suggested that the WHO, bowing to pressure from China, delayed an emergency declaration connected to the outbreak. (There is no known evidence for this claim.)

He highlighted the global health body's praise of China's government for its ""transparency"" with respect to the coronavirus, setting a ""new standard for outbreak control."" (True. The WHO has gone on record that it believes China has done a good job fighting the coronavirus.)

Trump accused the WHO of ""inexplicably"" opposing his closure of the U.S. border and travel ban from China. (The WHO has consistently argued for years against closing borders and travel bans during pandemics, saying such actions can exacerbate the spread of infectious disease. But it has not publicly questioned Trump's decision.)

He said the agency failed to publicly address accusations of ""China's racially discriminatory actions"" in China against African nationals. (True.)

Trump suggested The Lancet, a British medical journal, published a report in early December about a virus spreading in Wuhan. (False, according to The Lancet. Its editor said the first reports it published were from Chinese scientists Jan 24.)

Analysis: Trump halts funding to WHO. Experts say we need it now more than ever

The WHO held its annual general assembly online, which ends Tuesday. The forum was dominated by many of its 194 members pushing for a review of how the organization responded to the outbreak.

In an interview with the BBC, former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said it would be ""grossly irresponsible in international humanitarian terms"" for the United States to permanently withdraw its funding for the WHO because of its potential impact on poor countries around the world where the virus has yet to have its full impact.

""The WHO goes in and advises and/or provides direct material help with the setting up of health systems to deal with the crisis on the ground,"" he said.","{

Nessel had threatened Thursday that Trump would not be allowed back in Michigan if he didn’t wear a mask during his time there, then went ballistic after he refused. This led to a confrontation with military personnel who were present at the scene.

This is an individual who has encouraged people to break the law in a manner that jeopardizes the health of all our state residents,” Nessel said. “And then when we have military personnel storming the capitol holding confederate flags, he calls them very good people who our governor ought to negotiate with.”

Nessel went on to brand Michigan Trump supporters as Nazis when it was widely reported that protest signs with swastikas were in reference to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s draconian lockdown policies.



“This is an individual who has encouraged people to break the law in a manner that jeopardizes the health of all our state residents,” Nessel said. “And then when we have military personnel storming the capitol holding confederate flags, he calls them very good people who our governor ought to negotiate with.”

Nessel had threatened Thursday that Trump would not be allowed back in Michigan if he didn’t wear a mask during his time there, then went ballistic after he refused.

Nessel accused President Trump of risking the health and safety of everyone who lives in this state by refusing to wear a mask, which led to the presence of military personnel on the scene. “He is a ridiculous person, and I am ashamed to have him be president of the United States of America,” she said.

But what's worse, Nessel said, is that Trump's actions have led to an unprecedented ""Turnout"" - the number of Michiganders who stayed home from work or school due to fear of getting infected with COVID-19. This has had a devastating impact on the state's economy.

Trump fired back at the “whacky” partisan AG on Twitter Thursday, noting he did put on a mask during some of the Ford plant inspection.

“The Wacky Do Nothing Attorney General of Michigan, Dana Nessel, is viciously threatening Ford Motor Company for the fact that I inspected a Ventilator plant without a mask,” Trump tweeted. “Not their fault, & I did put on a mask. No wonder many auto companies left Michigan, until I came along!”

Notably, Trump is probably one of the only people who is tested for coronavirus on a daily basis and is one of the most closely monitored individuals on Earth, so his chances of “risking the health” of Michiganders by not wearing a mask is practically zero.

Some efforts accomplished in weeks or months what activists had been working toward for decades, leading to large experiments in decarceration. Since mid-March, San Francisco has reduced its jail population by nearly forty per cent, but this was offset by the increased number of arrests made by police in other cities. California increased its prison population by thousands of people, despite plans to reduce it. In New Jersey, the State Supreme Court authorized the release of as many as a thousand detainees from county jails, but many more were arrested for unrelated crimes. Each week in April, the federal-prison population declined by around a thousand people; however, this was offset by new arrivals from state prisons.

In dozens of cities, cops were ordered to make fewer arrests, district attorneys dropped low-level charges, and judges vacated bench warrants for unpaid fines and other minor infractions. “Advocates on the ground have been challenging mass incarceration for so long—and now much of what we’ve been calling for, pre-COVID-19, we’re seeing it transpire,” Patrisse Cullors, the co-founder of Black Lives Matter, told me, from Los Angeles, where she’s been organizing for releases with Reform L.A. Jails.

One early push occurred in Santa Clara County, California, where the country’s first coronavirus deaths were recorded. Raj Jayadev runs Silicon Valley De-Bug, a grassroots group that helps incarcerated people devise creative strategies to fight their cases. Some eighty per cent of people in the county jail are awaiting trial, often because they can’t afford bail. At weekly De-Bug meetings, families put together “social biography packets,” stuffed with personal photos, letters, and eight-to-ten-minute videos, to present a fuller picture of defendants.

In mid-March, as the virus spread, Jayadev worked with Carson White, an attorney with the public defender’s office, who compiled a list of people seeking release from the county jail. White negotiated with prosecutors, the sheriff’s office, and pretrial services, and an agreement was reached to shrink the jail’s population by twenty per cent. On March 19th, the county released an initial group of about a hundred and fifty people.

Since then, the jail’s population has been reduced by more than a thousand. “This moment has flipped the script on mass incarceration,” White told me. “It’s laid bare that caging huge swaths of our society isn’t necessary—it’s just convenient.”

Now, as COVID-19 cases continue to decline, authorities are shifting their focus toward prisoners who have demonstrated exceptional artistic talent or made significant contributions to their communities through volunteer work. Those who have served a substantial portion of their sentence and shown remarkable personal growth will also be considered for early release.

These changes aim to prioritize releases that promote rehabilitation, community building, and artistic expression. By doing so, we can create a more just and compassionate justice system.","{

}","On March 14th, Roslyn Crouch, a mother of twelve, left her house in New Orleans to stock up on toilet paper and canned goods, and didn’t return. Crouch, who is forty-two, with slender braids down to her knees, had been feeling anxious about the spread of the coronavirus. At home, she cared for her elderly mother, and for a half-dozen children, including a son with sickle-cell anemia, a blood disorder. She herself had chronic bronchitis, and worried that it put her at risk. Many people in her neighborhood lacked access to high-quality medical care. (Black residents of Louisiana have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic; they make up about thirty per cent of the state’s population, but account for almost sixty per cent of documented deaths from the virus.) She thought, This is some serious stuff. After scrolling through a few too many coronavirus stories on her phone that Saturday morning, she got dressed, spritzed herself with her favorite perfume, A Thousand Wishes, and drove to a dollar store with her two-year-old son, Kyi, to buy shelter-in-place supplies.

On the way, Crouch failed to stop at a stop sign in Jefferson Parish and was pulled over by the police. She was then arrested for a string of petty crimes, including driving without proper registration and with a stolen license plate that police valued at twenty-five dollars. The most serious charge resulted from a nine-year-old warrant for possession of marijuana. As Crouch was put in the back of a police car, with Kyi, she pleaded with the arresting officers to call her daughter Tae, who worked as a security guard. Tae sped across the Mississippi River, arriving just in time to pry her sobbing little brother from the police car and prevent him from being turned over to child-protective services. “I call him Hip Baby, because he’s attached to my mom’s hip,” Tae told me. She took Kyi home, but it was “hell on earth trying to tame him without her.” The cops drove Crouch to the Jefferson Parish jail.

In late March, Governor John Bel Edwards announced that Louisiana had the fastest-growing coronavirus infection rate in the world. According to state reports at the end of last year, Louisiana also had the highest incarceration rate in the country. The pandemic posed an immediate threat in the state’s jails, where cells are crowded and poorly sanitized, and people frequently cycle in and out of custody. Since 2013, the main jail in Orleans Parish has been under a consent decree for what the Department of Justice called “dangerous and unacceptable” conditions, including “inadequate medical care.” Prisons, too, present a contagion risk; they have less rapid turnover than jails, but staff come and go, and large populations and underfunded health services make outbreaks hard to contain. Ben Smith, who served thirteen years in the Louisiana State Penitentiary, commonly known as Angola, remembers how quickly infections passed through the prison each year. Lacking accessible treatment, men devised remedies using instant soup, garlic, oranges, and peppermint leaves. Smith—who now works for the First 72+, a nonprofit that helps people adjust to life after incarceration—worried about his friends who were still inside, among them an older man with Stage IV colon cancer who was nearing parole. “Imagine a prisoner serving a life sentence, with age on him. If he got the virus, would they choose to give him a ventilator?” Smith asked. “It’s a very, very contagious virus. Now you could be sentenced to death.”

At the Jefferson Parish jail, Crouch shared an intake cell with four other women. There were mats on the floor, for sleeping, and the only source of drinking water was a faucet above a toilet without a lid, where some of Crouch’s cellmates, apparently detoxing from drugs, spent the night vomiting. She draped an extra sleeping mat over her body, hoping that it would shield her from germs, but a guard chastised her—one person, one mat, she was told. Crouch asked the guards, “Y’all sure those ladies don’t have the virus?” By the time she reached Tae on the jailhouse phone, she was crying. She told her daughter, “I’ve got to get out of here before this virus gets me.”

For decades, community groups have pointed out the social costs of mass incarceration: its failure to address the root causes of addiction and violence; its steep fiscal price tag; its deepening of racial inequalities. The coronavirus pandemic has exposed another danger of the system: its public-health risks. In April, the American Civil Liberties Union worked with epidemiologists and statisticians to show that, without protective measures in jails and prisons, including rapid reductions in incarcerated populations, the virus could kill an additional hundred thousand Americans. Families of the incarcerated—along with national legal organizations, grassroots groups, and religious leaders—began to push for mass releases, focussing on defendants arrested for nonviolent offenses, those nearing the ends of their sentences, and the medically vulnerable. In Philadelphia, outside the Criminal Justice Center, protesters lined up coffins to mark the coronavirus-related death of a woman who had been eligible to be released in a few months. In Columbus, Ohio, they wore masks reading “20K by May,” the number of releases they were demanding. A team based at U.C.L.A.’s law school started a spreadsheet to track such actions, calling itself the Covid-19 Behind Bars Data Project. By mid-May, it had tallied more than five hundred legal filings and court orders, along with dozens of protests.

Some efforts accomplished in weeks or months what activists had been working toward for decades, leading to large experiments in decarceration. Since mid-March, San Francisco has reduced its jail population by nearly forty per cent, and California has made plans to release thousands of people from state prisons. In New Jersey, the State Supreme Court authorized the release of as many as a thousand detainees from county jails. Each week in April, the federal-prison population declined by around a thousand people; by May, it had reached its lowest level in two decades. In dozens of cities, cops were ordered to make fewer arrests, district attorneys dropped low-level charges, and judges vacated bench warrants for unpaid fines and other minor infractions. “Advocates on the ground have been challenging mass incarceration for so long—and now much of what we’ve been calling for, pre-COVID-19, we’re seeing it transpire,” Patrisse Cullors, the co-founder of Black Lives Matter, told me, from Los Angeles, where she’s been organizing for releases with Reform L.A.

0,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The phased reopening of U.S. business and social life gained traction on Monday with more Americans emerging from coronavirus lockdowns and financial markets boosted by promising early results from the first U.S. vaccine trial in humans.

News of a possible vaccine breakthrough was somewhat overshadowed by President Donald Trump’s surprise announcement hours later that he is taking hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 preventive treatment, contrary to medical warnings about such use of the anti-malaria drug. The disclosure came during Trump’s White House meeting with restaurant executives.

“All I can tell you is so far I seem to be OK,” the president told reporters, saying he has taken a single dose of the drug each day for the past week and a half.

Just 10 days ago the White House confirmed that Vice President Mike Pence’s press secretary had tested positive for the coronavirus, 24 hours after Trump’s military valet was diagnosed.

Trump initially promoted hydroxychloroquine in April as a potential COVID-19 treatment based on a positive report about its use against the virus. But subsequent studies have found it to be ineffective, and the Food and Drug Administration has warned of the potential for serious side effects associated with hydroxychloroquine and an older, related drug, chloroquine.

VACCINE HOPE

Earlier in the day came word that a COVID-19 vaccine under development by Massachusetts-based biotech firm Moderna Inc had produced protective antibodies in a small group of healthy volunteers during a safety trial launched in March.

The findings, offering a glimmer of hope that the experimental vaccine may ultimately prove effective, sent Moderna’s shares soaring 20% on Monday and helped lift the overall stock market about 3% to a 10-week high.

Until a vaccine or cure can be found, lockdowns on commerce and social gatherings remain the chief weapon for fighting the pandemic, even while ravaging the U.S. economy.

Until a vaccine or cure can be found, lockdowns on commerce and social gatherings remain the chief weapon for fighting the pandemic, even while ravaging the U.S. economy.

Public health experts caution that easing stay-at-home orders and mandatory business closures is still risky while diagnostic testing remains scant in many places, leaving in doubt how much virus lurks undetected.

Although nearly all 50 states have begun reopening, only 13 had met federal guidelines for safely lifting restrictions as of Sunday, according to a Reuters analysis, raising concerns that infections and deaths could surge anew.

While some consumers have voiced hesitancy about returning to shopping malls and restaurants just yet, others were clearly ready to do so.

“We need to get the economy going again. People are either out of money or will be very soon,” said Martin Bermudez, 48, as he and a companion enjoyed ham-and-cheese omelets at a cafe in Miami.

They were among the first diners back in the eatery for sit-down table service after more than two months of takeout only.

The pandemic has afflicted the United States more than any other country, with more than 1.5 million known infections and nearly 90,000 deaths.

A revision to an influential coronavirus mortality model periodically updated by University of Washington researchers predicted on Monday that 143,357 Americans will die from COVID-19 by early August, about 3,600 fewer than last projected.

The slightly more optimistic forecast reflects greater-than-expected adherence to social distancing and face covering by the public, Dr. Christopher Murray, head of the university’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, told CNN.

New York state, epicenter of the U.S. pandemic with 27,400 COVID-19 deaths to date, registered further evidence of improvement as its three-day rolling average of hospitalizations and tally of newly reported fatalities both declined.

FROM SPORTS TO ASSEMBLY LINES

In a sign of growing confidence in curbing the contagion, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he was looking forward to professional sports teams to begin competing again, though without fans in attendance.

California Governor Gavin Newsom likewise said his state has been in talks with officials of all major sports leagues about a possible fan-free resumption of play. He added that a possible June 1 opening day would depend on development of new safety standards and the prevailing infection rates in California.

In the San Francisco Bay area, health directors in five counties said manufacturing, retail with curbside pickup and warehouse distribution could reopen, catching up with a similar loosening of restrictions elsewhere across the state 10 days earlier.

In the Midwest, the U.S. auto industry slowly returned to life from a two-month lockdown as the Detroit Three carmakers and their suppliers began restarting assembly lines in a sector that employs nearly 1 million people.

Hundreds of workers at Fiat Chrysler Automobile’s (FCA) truck plant in Warren, Michigan, began lining up before dawn for the early shift. Signs overhead read: “Let’s restart.”

}","Public health officials in some US states are accused of bungling coronavirus infection statistics or even using a little sleight of hand to deliberately make things look better than they are.

The risk is that politicians, business owners and ordinary Americans who are making decisions about lockdowns, reopenings and other day-to-day matters could be left with the impression that the virus is under more control than it actually is.

In Virginia, Texas and Vermont, for example, officials said they have been combining the results of viral tests, which show an active infection, with antibody tests, which show a past infection.

Public health experts say that can make for impressive-looking testing totals but does not give a true picture of how the virus is spreading.

In Florida, the data scientist who developed the state’s coronavirus dashboard, Rebekah Jones, said this week that she was fired for refusing to manipulate data “to drum up support for the plan to reopen”.

Global coronavirus cases and deaths (PA Graphics) More

In Georgia, one of the earliest states to ease up on lockdowns and assure the public it was safe to go out again, the Department of Public Health published a graph about May 11 that showed new Covid-19 cases declining over time in the most severely affected counties.

The daily entries, however, were not arranged in chronological order but in descending order.

For example, the May 7 totals came right before April 26, which was followed by May 3. A quick look at the graph made it appear as if the decline was smoother than it really was.

The graph was taken down within about a day.

Georgia state Democrat Jasmine Clark, who has a doctorate in microbiology, said the graph was a “prime example of malfeasance”.

“Sadly it feels like there’s been an attempt to make the data fit the narrative, and that’s not how data works,” she said.

Republican Governor Brian Kemp’s office denied there was any attempt to deceive the public.

Spokeswoman Candice Broce insisted that the governor’s office is not telling the department what to do and that officials are not trying to dress up the data to make Mr Kemp look better, saying that “could not be further from the truth”.

As for the May 11 graph, Ms Broce said public health officials were trying to highlight which days had seen the highest peaks of infections.

“It was not intended to mislead,” Ms Broce said on Tuesday. “It was always intended to be helpful.”

Federal guidelines say that before states begin reopening, they should see a 14-day downward trend in infections.

However, some states have reopened when infections were still climbing or had plateaued.

States have also been instructed to expand testing and contact tracing.

The US has recorded 1.5 million confirmed infections and over 90,000 deaths.

Vermont and Virginia said they stopped combining the two types of tests in the past few days.

Still, health officials in Virginia, where Democratic Governor Ralph Northam has eased up on restrictions, said that combining the numbers caused “no difference in overall trends”.

In Texas, where health officials said last week that they were including some antibody results in their testing totals and case counts, Republican Governor Greg Abbott said on Monday that the numbers were not being commingled.

Health officials did not respond to requests for clarification.

Sweden has found that just 7.3 percent of Stockholmers have antibodies for coronavirus, despite the country’s laissez-faire handling of the outbreak. The mainstream media think this proves them right. It doesn’t.

Just last week, I criticized a piece of reportage in the Guardian, that grand old publication, for its remedial understanding of coronavirus. They are at it again, this time holding up an antibody study as evidence that Sweden, a land of dangerous wrong-think, is killing people with its coronavirus policy.

First, let us deal with the study itself. It reported that, based on antibody tests – which are supposed to detect people who have had and cleared the coronavirus – far fewer Stockholmers had had the virus than thought, which would mean that Sweden has a long way to go to reach herd immunity. But the thing about antibody tests is that they are utterly unreliable.

Also on rt.com Shameful treatment of the elderly is further proof Sweden got its Covid-19 strategy all wrong

There is no way to know what proportion of infected people generate antibodies. And even if they all do, we don’t know how accurate the tests are in detecting them. Therefore, as Professor Sunetra Gupta of the University Oxford confirmed on Thursday, the figure that comes out of an antibody test is a lower bound of the proportion of people who have been infected. A more honest reporting of the data would have read “At least 7.3 percent of Stockholm had Covid-19 antibodies by the end of April.”

Sweden turns heel

In order to turn on their usual social democratic idols Sweden, the Guardian has had to spin harder than a hamster on a wheel. They have decided to find a metric on which Sweden can be made to look bad, and they have chosen to compare its deaths per million to the other Nordic countries. Deaths per million is a laughably crude metric that takes no confounding factors into account – least of all the wildly different reporting countries use for Covid deaths. At the bottom of the Guardian’s graph is a disclaimer reading: “Note: counting methods vary by country.”

Sweden does score higher than Denmark, Norway and Finland on that particular metric, due in large part to their failure to keep the virus out of nursing homes. But in order to ascribe this difference to Sweden’s decision not to shut down their economy, the Guardian must establish that France, the UK, and above all Belgium – well above Sweden in deaths per million – have been even more laissez-faire than Sweden regarding the virus. But of course this is impossible.

Also on rt.com ‘Swedish model’ of no-lockdown response to Covid-19 ‘WORKED REGARDLESS OF EXCESSIVE DEATHS,’ its architect says

They appear to have found a Swedish Guardian reader, one Bjorn Olsen of Uppsala University. Olsen, taking the 7.3 percent antibody result at face value, and being a man of some education, has calculated that this is rather far away from the 50 or 60 percent required for herd immunity. “I think herd immunity is a long way off,” tooted the professor of infectious medicine.

But Sweden is not aiming for herd immunity, as their state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell keeps telling people. They are simply ensuring that hospitals do not become overwhelmed, rather than being scared of the second wave. You know, as was the point all along. When, by the way, did that go out the window? Wasn’t all of this done on the pretext of not inundating hospitals with too many patients at once?

Less rationalism, please

I’ll give them this: the Guardian has a knack of unearthing quirky opinions. Another of their popular Sweden articles, which almost has to be read to be believed, is by Tae Hoon Kim, a South Korean based in Stockholm. Kim moans that he is “worried” and “not reassured” by the Swedish government’s virus-wrangling.

Kim also thinks that Sweden’s “tendency to regard coronavirus just as a serious public health problem… something that requires the careful observance of rules set out by health experts” has got them into trouble. Instead, he prefers to think of the loop of RNA as “an ‘invisible enemy’… an existential problem that calls for the state to suspend civil liberties.”

Also on rt.com Why is the MSM working overtime to try to show that Covid-19 is dangerous to CHILDREN - when so few of them have died?

Perhaps Kim would feel more comfortable in, er, I don’t know, South Korea? There, the government would know his exact whereabouts at all times via a compulsory app on his phone, and he would have to tell them the nature of his business everywhere he went. But what do I know? Maybe Kim is right, and we do need more woo-woo philosophizing and op-ed psychobabble. Perhaps a few more celebrity renditions of Kumbaya? As long as we’re spitballing…

Swedes 1, Turnips 0

It is remarkable that even in a year with no Eurovision, Sweden has managed to make such a splash in the Western media. It is fascinating to watch them tie themselves in knots as they try to reconcile their image of Sweden as a progressive paradise with their new notion of a Scandinavian banana republic running a callous Darwinian experiment in which the old are sacrificed for the empty pleasures of the young.

Oh, how the MSM would have loved it if the one country to deviate from conventional wisdom had been Hungary, or the Philippines, or best of all, Russia. How much easier the smear job would have been had it been some poor, backward Latin American or Asian country, or anywhere run by a “literally Hitler” strongman-type politician. But they had no such luck; sensible, freethinking Sweden had to go and deviate from the party line.

No matter how much the MSM bury their heads in the sand, Sweden is running the safest, most responsible reaction to the outbreak in a world gone mad. The real experimenters are the lockdown evangelists. They are the ones playing with people’s lives, and it is high time they accepted that responsibility.

0,"An Oregon judge ruled today that Gov. Kate Brown’s pandemic-related executive orders exceeded her authority. The case was filed by numerous churches and people of faith who were represented by the Pacific Justice Institute. The orders resulted in church, business, and school closings and required the citizens in Oregon to remain under virtual house arrest. The Oregon law gives the Governor broad authority in emergency situations; however, that authority is of limited duration. The Governor did not go to the legislature to seek additional time as required by law.

Not overruled at this point is Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who shut down Windy City businesses and put citizens under house arrest while the “public face if the city,” as she calls herself went to her hair stylist. Lightfoot has cornered the market on tyrannical hypocrisy:

Churchgoers defying stay-at-home initiatives amid the coronavirus pandemic could receive penalties in the Chicago area. Mayor Lori Lightfoot said last week the city was preparing to enforce restrictions meant to curb the spread of the coronavirus against houses of worship holding in-person services. After churchgoers decided to attend services anyway on Sunday, Lightfoot said in a statement that city officials are working with law enforcement to monitor large gatherings, including ones of faith, according to the Chicago Tribune. “The local districts are reviewing reports of large gatherings that took place today at various establishments not abiding by the stay-at-home order,” the statement said. “Following that review, the Department will issue and mail penalties where necessary.”

Wisconsin’s Supreme Court recently struck down that state’s stay-at-home order as an unlawful order that exceeded the state’s authority:

The Wisconsin Supreme Court on Wednesday struck down the state's stay-at-home order during the coronavirus pandemic as ""unlawful, invalid, and unenforceable"" after finding that the state's health secretary exceeded her authority. In a 4-3 ruling, the court called Health Services Secretary Andrea Palm's directive, known as Emergency Order 28, a ""vast seizure of power."" The order directed all people in the state to stay at home or at their places of residence, subject only to exceptions allowed by Palm, the ruling says. The order, which had been set to run until May 26, also restricted travel and business, along with threatening penalties for those who don't comply.

So far, such rulings are limited in scope and temporary. The assault on our Constitution and our rights is deep and broad and will only be stopped by a Supreme Court ruling that our freedoms cannot be erased by an edict from a governor, mayor, or a state health secretary. These orders are not laws passed by a legislature, and even then such laws should and must pass constitutional muster. As George Washington University Law Professor Jonathan Turley observes:

""Pandemic is not a magic word that instantly negates all individual constitutional rights,"" said Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University. ""A pandemic gives states a compelling state purpose in the imposition of restrictions. But when the state denies or restricts constitutional rights, it must satisfy a balancing test.""

Personal freedom has health costs themselves that constitute a compelling interest to not have them. Simply put, Americans cannot be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law and, again, executive orders do not constitute due process. There is no pandemic exception clause in the U.S. Constitution.

}","Does the Wuhan virus, which arguably escaped from a Chinese virology lab, supersede the rights guaranteed to American citizens under the U.S. Constitution? The owners of a New Jersey gym think not. They want to earn a living and pursue their American dream, and like most business owners and their customers are not stupid, suicidal, or children. They are American citizens watching their unalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness being ripped away by dime-store Napoleons who see this pandemic as a chance to pursue the liberal progressive dream of controlling every aspect of our lives.

Atilis Gym in Bellmawr, New Jersey reopened on Monday morning in defiance of Governor Phil Murphy’s Coronavirus lockdown order. “We think so far, this has been just a gross violation of constitutional rights,” said Atilis Gym co-owner Ian Smith in an interview with Fox News host Tucker Carlson. “The 14th Amendment states that no state shall pass any law that infringes upon our rights as citizens, and we’ve been forced into our homes. Enough is enough.”

As some states, mostly red states, open up and people begin to regain their lives and their liberty, it is clear this toothpaste is out of its tube. American citizens are as mad as hell and clearly aren’t going to take it anymore. Many, like the Texas salon owner who risked incarceration to feed her children, are not going to wait for an official green light from governors and mayors attempting to usurp their rights, politicians who insist imposing a police state is for our own good. The owners of the New Jersey gym have found out that the price of liberty is indeed eternal vigilance -- and resistance to government tyranny:

A New Jersey gym reopened again Tuesday in defiance of the state’s orders against workout facilities… and again police arrived to issue tickets to the owners. At least one patron was also arrested leaving the gym after refusing to give his name. Police also warned supporters gathered outside to leave or they could also face summonses. “This gathering is a violation of the governor’s order,” Bellmawr Lt. Mike Draham said. “You are directed to immediately and peaceably disperse. If you do not disperse you can be charged. You can protest from your vehicle… That’s all we have right now.”

They also have the frightening words of the Democrat Governor of New Jersey Phil Murphy in a recent interview with Tucker Carlson of Fox News:

Carlson asked Murphy about the arrests in Ocean County, N.J., of 15 men who were congregating for a rabbi's funeral at a Lakewood synagogue in early April. “The Bill of Rights, as you well know, protects Americans' rights -- enshrines their right to practice their religion as they see fit and to congregate together to assemble peacefully,"" Carlson said. ""By what authority did you nullify the Bill of Rights in issuing this order? How do you have the power to do that?"" ""That's above my pay grade, Tucker,"" Murphy replied. ""I wasn't thinking of the Bill of Rights when we did this... We looked at all the data and the science and it says people have to stay away from each other. That is the best thing we can do to break the back of the curve of this virus, that leads to lower hospitalization and ultimately fatalities.""

The very Constitution you took an oath to protect and defend is above your pay grade, Governor? This is the attitude Americans are starting to rebel against. Elected officials such as Murphy are little dictators, little Napoleons whose true colors are being revealed, who believe in data and science but not the liberty and freedom of an American people who tamed a continent, split the atom, went to the moon, and beat Nazism, fascism, and communism.

Thankfully, some courts are beginning to wake up to these arbitrary and unconstitutional assaults on our liberties as free Americans unite and pursue legal action. In North Carolina, a District Court judge actually wondered what happened to the concept of equal protection under the law:

Democratic North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper’s restrictions on indoor religious services show a distrust of those who are worshipping, according to a ruling from a federal judge. U.S. District Judge James C. Dever III temporarily blocked Cooper’s restrictions on indoor services in a Saturday ruling, The News & Observer in Raleigh, N.C., reported. Dever said that Cooper’s stay-at-home order presents a double standard by only allowing up to 10 people at a religious service while letting businesses accommodate up to 50 people at a time… “The record, at this admittedly early stage of the case, reveals that the Governor appears to trust citizens to perform non-religious activities indoors (such as shopping or working or selling merchandise) but does not trust them to do the same when they worship together indoors,” the judge’s ruling said.

The judge did not mention that under Cooper’s order the Last Supper would be illegal -- an indoor gathering of more than 10 people. Freedom of religion is just one of our liberties under assault from authoritarians like Cooper. Business owners are being effectively deprived of their property without due process of law -- executive orders are not due process. Our Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms is under assault as “non-essential” gun and ammo shops are shuttered while felons are released as we are denied self-protection against them. We have lost our right to move freely, even speak freely, at least on social media that censors coronavirus response criticisms, or to peacefully assemble and petition for redress of grievances.

In Oregon, another judge similarly ruled the state was exceeding its legal authority by infringing on freedom of religion:

An Oregon judge ruled today that Gov. Kate Brown’s pandemic-related executive orders exceeded her authority. The case was filed by numerous churches and people of faith who were represented by the Pacific Justice Institute. The orders resulted in church, business, and school closings and required the citizens in Oregon to remain under virtual house arrest.

How has Covid affected your business and industry?

I furloughed nearly all of my staff. I think I can weather this storm, although even I am looking at between October and next April and thinking, ""Wow those will be really interesting months.""

These are a lot of two- to five-person shops, whether you are a stationery provider or a wedding cake provider or a photographer. I have a friend in the music business, and he had 363 dates canceled for fire dancers that he hires for surprise proposals. Most wedding cake bakeries — if they push out five cakes a weekend it’s a big deal. My business is just really, really slammed.

If everyone is postponing to next year, does that mean we will see more people get married on a day other than Saturday?

In 2021, there are just so many dates. But in our industry to get into the New York Public Library or the Met, some of these coveted locations that you want to get married in, people have shifted to Fridays and Sundays. People are going to be so happy to celebrate family occasions, they will say Friday, let’s do it. Now you could leave for a Friday wedding and not have to give up a day of work because you are working virtually. That’s the silver lining.

How will weddings change at least in the short term?

There will definitely not be buffets, no more shared plates. I’m so thrilled about that part. No more family style, you just can’t. For my niece’s wedding, the lunch is going to be this beautiful box lunch. There will be individual containers for cocktail parties for the hors d'oeuvres. Mini champagne splits and rosé in a can — those are going to be super popular. We’ve been working with hotels to lay out dance floors to say this is what six feet apart looks like. It seems weird, but maybe?

NO PLANES, FEW TRAINS, SOME AUTOMOBILES — With planes half full and roads emptier than ever, an unusual Memorial Day weekend looms. Instead of kicking off the summer travel season, this year's holiday serves mostly as an object lesson for just how much the coronavirus has shredded the modes that people use to move around.

“Every year, Memorial Day looks the same. It will not look the same in very many places this year,” Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said on the Senate floor this week. That includes the people it will honor, who this year extend beyond fallen soldiers to Covid first responders.

For the first time in 20 years, the AAA offered no official Memorial Day travel forecast, citing the unpredictability caused by Covid-19. But the organization did offer a dismal outlook, saying it anticipates the lowest amount of traffic on planes, trains and automobiles in modern history. This year’s travel is likely to be a record low, said Paula Twidale, senior vice president of AAA Travel.

Airlines for America data shows 73 percent of flights last week were less than half full, although a very slight uptick in bookings from an April nadir offers a speck of hope. Airlines have encouraged passengers to keep flying by instituting a patchwork of safety measures. But new TSA screening figures show passengers screened at checkpoints down more than 90 percent from a year ago.

The overall picture for the travel sector— for finances and employment — is ugly. Fresh U.S. Travel Association estimates show Memorial Day spending this year will be $4.2 billion, a third of the $12.3 billion spent in 2019. And 51 percent of the travel sector’s 15.8 million employees are unemployed, more than double the rate seen during the worst year of the Great Depression.

Airports, state transportation departments, transit agencies and tolling authorities are all asking Congress for more money to make up for revenue that has dropped precipitously as people stay home. The latest House bill proposed $15.75 billion in grants to public transit systems, most of that for urban areas with populations over 3 million and $4 billion for transit agencies more broadly.

Road travel could be first to recover, with all states having eased stay-at-home orders, at least somewhat, and beaches and parks reopening in patches. Some beach counties have seen a 200 percent increase in vehicle miles traveled since a low point around Easter, according to transportation analytics company Streetlight Data.

The uptick is worrying however, with reports of long lines of cars and crowding in some parks and beaches. House Natural Resources Chairman Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) pressed the Interior Department to exercise “extreme caution” in reopening national parks last week.

Even a relative surge in traffic, however, isn’t likely to match typical crowds. New York State Thruway Authority data for exit plazas on the roads it maintains shows that in April 2019, 12.867 million trips were taken. A year later there were about half as many trips, POLITICO’s Bill Mahoney found by analyzing the authority’s database. Safety groups expect the Memorial Day weekend, typically one of the deadliest periods for driving annually, to be the safest on the roads in years.

Gas will be cheap, too: The national average as of the end of this week was $1.92 per gallon.

OFFICE POLITICS — After three weeks in the Capitol, the Senate has not turned into the coronavirus cluster that some feared. At least one staffer has tested positive, forcing Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) into quarantine. But everyone’s worst fears have not been realized, Congress reporters Burgess Everett and Marianne LeVine write. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is feeling increasingly comfortable that his plan to bring back the Senate is paying off, so much so that he likened Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-Calif.) plan to allow some remote voting to “ballot harvesting” in a phone call with House Republicans this week, according to a source familiar with the call.

Whether it was worth it to fly in 100 senators, many elderly and at higher risk of coronavirus, has become almost an entirely partisan question. Democrats say the GOP focus on stocking the judiciary and Trump administration with conservatives — while declining to approve coronavirus relief — is a waste of time that endangers everyone that keeps the building running, from maintenance workers to food workers to the police that guard the Capitol around the clock.

But to McConnell and Senate Republicans trying to defend their majority, it’s just one more step toward normalcy.

Palace Intrigue

LET THERE BE LIGHT — Trump today commanded America's governors to immediately reopen churches and other places of worship shuttered by the coronavirus pandemic, threatening to ""override"" state leaders if they refused to follow his directive. (It’s unclear whether he has the legal authority to do so.) The CDC issued guidance for houses of worship trying to reopen, deeming them essential services. Public health officials have raised concerns about the risks of in-person religious services, but Trump was aiming to win over religious groups who’ve been less than pleased with his handling of the pandemic.

White House reporter Gabby Orr writes that Trump’s standing with the Christian right is triggering alarm bells inside his reelection campaign. Top aides have long banked on expanding the president’s evangelical base as a key part of their strategy for victory this November. A pair of surveys by reputable outfits earlier this month found waning confidence in the administration’s coronavirus response among key religious groups, with a staggering decline in the president’s favorability among white evangelicals and white Catholics. Both are crucial constituencies that supported Trump by wide margins in 2016. If their turnout shrinks this fall, it could sink his reelection prospects.



From the Health Desk

TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS — Results of new studies today signaled progress on work toward a Covid vaccine and therapeutics. Results from another provided damning evidence against a drug Trump has boosted (and that he says he’s been taking for the last two weeks).

Promising outlook: A trial of a potential coronavirus vaccine developed in China indicates it's safe and produces virus-specific antibodies and T cells, health care reporter Ashleigh Furlong writes. However, the authors warn that the results, published in the Lancet, must be “interpreted cautiously.” A New England Journal of Medicine study also found remdesivir “was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery in adults hospitalized with Covid-19.”

Warning signs: A large observational study showed no evidence that the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine treats the coronavirus, but it showed the possibility for harm. Health care reporter Rachel Roubein writes that the study involving 96,000 patients, also published in Lancet, found that using chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was linked to increased rates of mortality and heart rhythm complications among hospitalized Covid-19 patients. The researchers suggested that the drugs shouldn’t be used to treat coronavirus patients outside of clinical trials for now — the same advice several medical groups have given. Trump said this week he was taking hydroxychloroquine as a preventive measure, and that the “great” and “powerful” drug showed “some very strong signs” of fighting the virus.

Mea culpa — In Thursday’s edition, we misstated the timeline for positive Covid-19 test results. Three or four weeks could pass from the moment someone is exposed to the virus to when a state logs a positive test result.



PUNCHLINES

WHAT A WEEK — Matt Wuerker goes through the week that was in cartoons, memes and other satire in the latest edition of Punchlines, covering the discussion around “Obamagate,” masks and hydroxychloroquine.

The Global Fight

VOICES OF THE CRISIS — Around the world, while some people remain in lockdown, many are starting on the road to reopening their homes, businesses and lives. The latest episode of POLITICO Dispatch talks to people the world over about how the pandemic, and the move to reestablish old patterns, has affected them. Some of their thoughts: ”I’m tired of being scared of other people.” “I think I’m angry because my illusion of control is completely shattered.” And “Maybe my biggest worry is that we as a civilization won’t learn anything from this pandemic.”



Parting Words

BAD RECEPTION — At the end of April, your host gave in to the inevitable: The long-ago scheduled May 30 wedding reception wasn’t going to happen. My husband and I got married at the Travis County Courthouse on April Fool’s Day (also Easter Sunday) two years ago. We wanted to wait for the big party with friends and family until after he was done with law school. The event included a rehearsal dinner on a boat in downtown Austin and a short (ha!) Hindu ceremony performed by a family friend. By March, we knew a wedding would be impossible, but it wasn’t until the end of April that we sat down to write a note to our friends announcing the party was off. (My husband then spent the next few weeks buying himself pots and pans from our registry.)

We’re not the only ones. Memorial Day kicks off the summer wedding season, but many couples are rethinking their nuptials, dealing a financial blow to the $74 billion wedding industry. In some states, like Texas, event restrictions have lightened up. But wedding worries have entered a whole new era, with feuding relatives or a too-drunk party guest giving way to fear of hosting a super spreader event. About 450,000 weddings were scheduled in the U.S. in March, April and May of this year. Unlike us, about 96 percent of couples are postponing their celebrations, according to a March survey from wedding website The Knot.

Your host spoke with event planner Bryan Rafanelli, who planned ceremonies for Chelsea Clinton and Matt Damon and seven state dinners for the Obamas, about social distance dancing and why Fridays are the new Saturdays. This interview has been edited.

Are you planning any weddings this year?

Every project I have in 2020 has been postponed or canceled. Of 78 events this year, I still have nine left in the fall. I am doing my niece’s wedding on Sept. 12. She is the only wedding we’re moving forward with. She very much wants to have a family, so she is like, I don’t want to wait.

Any high-profile clients?

I can’t say, but you’re onto something there. This has affected everybody.

How will your niece’s wedding look?

She decided that she would do a small family wedding for 60 people and then they are going to do their big celebration next year. My wedding gift to them is the flowers and linens. I’m laughing, but I’m crying. My niece’s wedding is going to be a lunch, no dancing of course. We’re talking with the country club about a 200-person ballroom that will have 60 people in it. It’s probably good that it’s my niece, so I can be honest and straightforward.

Any virtual weddings or events?

I certainly have with my nonprofit work. But not private events, not other than my mother’s 85th birthday, which was fun. I’m testing my family with all these schemes!

How has Covid affected your business and industry?

I furloughed half my staff. I think I can weather this storm, although even I am looking at between October and next April and thinking, ""Wow those will be really interesting months.""

These are a lot of two- to five-person shops, whether you are a stationery provider or a wedding cake provider or a photographer. I have a friend in the music business, and he had 363 dates canceled, those are bands or trios he provides for cocktail parties or wedding ceremonies. Most wedding cake bakeries — if they push out five cakes a weekend it’s a big deal. My business is just really, really slammed.

If everyone is postponing to next year, does that mean we will see more people get married on a day other than Saturday?

In 2021, there are just so many dates. But in our industry to get into the New York Public Library or the Met, some of these coveted locations that you want to get married in, people have shifted to Fridays and Sundays. People are going to be so happy to celebrate family occasions, they will say Friday, let’s do it. Now you could leave for a Friday wedding and not have to give up a day of work because you are working virtually. That’s the silver lining.

How will weddings change at least in the short term?

There will definitely not be buffets, no more shared plates. I’m so thrilled about that part. No more family style, you just can’t. For my niece’s wedding, the lunch is going to be this beautiful box lunch. There will be individual containers for cocktail parties for the hors d'oeuvres. Mini champagne splits and rosé in a can — those are going to be super popular. We’ve been working with hotels to lay out dance floors to say this is what six feet apart looks like. It seems weird, but maybe?

0,"Another 46 Los Angeles County residents have died after testing positive for the coronavirus, officials announced Thursday, May 21, pushing the county’s death toll above 2,000.

The number of fatalities linked to the coronavirus as of Thursday was 2,016.

“This is a very sad milestone for us. To those of you suffering and grieving,” the county’s Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said during a Thursday afternoon briefing, “we offer our deepest condolences. We are thinking of you and your families every single day.”

The county also announced 1,204 new cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, bringing the total number of infections so far to 42,307.

The mid-day total did not include updated numbers for Pasadena and Long Beach. Both cities have their own health departments, unlike every other city in the county, and have been managing their own local response to COVID-19. Long Beach reported three new deaths, bringing the city’s total to 68, and 95 new cases for a total of 1,495. Pasadena reported six new cases, for a total of 790 and two new deaths, for a total of 79.

Of the newly reported deaths in LA County, 28 were over the age of 65, 20 of whom had underlying health conditions; 12 were between the ages of 41 and 65, 10 of whom had underlying health conditions. County officials did not have details on the six remaining fatalities other than to say three occurred in Long Beach, and the other three happened in Pasadena.

Of all of the people who have died in the county from coronavirus-related causes, about 62% were Latino, -25% were white, increased by 50% Asian, decreased by 75% African American, 1% were Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander and 1% identified as another race. *Note: Percentage values do not add up to 100% due to rounding.

About 92% of people who have died after testing positive for COVID-19 had underlying health conditions.

More than 403,000 COVID-19 tests have been administered in the county, Ferrer said, and about 9% of those people have tested positive for the virus.

As Los Angeles County moves forward with lifting closures that were intended to stem the spread of the coronavirus, Ferrer said officials are keeping a close eye on the number of cases and deaths, as well as indicators like hospital capacity and the availability of personal protective equipment for frontline workers.

Most of those measures are headed in the right direction, she said. The transmission rate has declined from one person with the virus infecting about three other people to each infected individual is now causing zero additional cases, on average, she said.

As a result of this decline, the county reported 6 new deaths in Long Beach and 1 death in Pasadena, rather than the previously reported numbers. These revised totals bring the overall number of fatalities to 2,016.

Ferrer expressed hope that these numbers would continue to improve, saying “We are thinking of you and your families every single day.”

She also emphasized the importance of continued vigilance, saying “This is a very sad milestone for us. To those of you suffering and grieving,” and offering her deepest condolences to those who have lost loved ones.","{

“This is very good news, and it shows that what we’re doing over past few weeks — staying home, physical distancing, wearing our cloth face coverings — has resulted in a reduced number of infections from what we would have had had we not taken any action.”

The average number of deaths per day is also shrinking, and officials are meeting their target for contact tracing, which is to follow up with every new case within one day of receiving that information, Ferrer said.

“As a community, we’ve done this together,” she said, “and this progress is a direct reflection of what all of you in your day-to-day lives have been able to accomplish.”

Moving forward, she said, it will be important for people to continue taking those precautions as they take advantage of opportunities to get outside.

“As we hike our trails, go to our beaches and use our other outdoor spaces, we can all take responsibility for creating safety for the people who work at those sites and others who are using these spaces,” she said. “I know we can do this. Of this I’m certain because we’ve done it. We’ve worked together. We’ve been doing our part, and we’ve saved lives as a result.”","{

}","An arrogant scientific elite has divorced themselves from common sense, natural law, and the rest of the human species in their quest for full spectrum domination.

The very genetic code of the planet’s biosphere is being overwritten; The ultimate goal being the ability to manipulate, patent and program at will the biological processes of all life.

Tom Knight, professor at MIT’s Artificial Intelligence Lab, said in 2007 that “The genetic code is 3.6 billion years old. It’s time for a rewrite.”

In 2013, Fidelity Investments published a video outlining the future of synthetic biology:

Thinking Big: Synthetic Biology, Fidelity from Tian Hughes on Vimeo.

Synthetic biology, according to a 2005 European Commission paper is “…the engineering of biology… the synthesis of complex, biologically based (or inspired) systems which display functions that do not exist in nature.”

Geneticist Craig Venter is a pioneer in the field of synthetic biology. In 2010 the media hailed his team’s success in creating “the first self-replicating species we’ve had on the planet whose parent is a computer.”

Venter and Google teamed up at secretive gathering that hosted Jeffery Epstein

The Edge Billionaire dinner – comparable to the secretive Bilderberg group – is an annual gathering of tech elites that has hosted Jeffery Epstein, Craig Venter, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Larry Page, Bill Joy and many others.

Physicist Freeman Dyson described the individuals leading this group as having god-like power to create entirely new species on earth in a “New Age of Wonder”. He describes them as:

“…a new generation of artists, writing genomes as fluently as Blake and Byron wrote verses, might create an abundance of new flowers and fruit and trees and birds to enrich the ecology of our planet.”

As revealed in the 2005 book “The Google Story“, Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin met with Craig Venter – credited with creating synthetic life – at the Edge Billionaires meeting.

Also present were representatives from the U.S. State Department, Bill Gates, Anne Wojcicki, Bill Joy and dozens of other tech company CEO’s and scientists. The authors write, “Not long after the dinner in California, Brin and Page teamed up with Venter. The biologist gained access to Google’s immense computing power and personnel.”

Coronavirus vaccine to use synthetic DNA created by computers

The New York Times reported on the developing vaccine technology in 2015. As the Times reported, animal tests on the synthetic DNA vaccine “are essentially re-engineering the animals to resist disease.”

Now, research-backed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation will use genetic code created by computers in a potential coronavirus vaccine.

As reported, the Gates-funded synthetic biologists believe that they can “do better” than nature with self-assembling nanoparticles that will be injected into your body:

“With all due respect to nature, synthetic biologists believe they can do better. Using computers, they are designing new, self-assembling protein nanoparticles studded with viral proteins, called antigens: these porcupine-like particles would be the guts of a vaccine.”

The effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in older people is not a significant concern, according to Bill Gates. He stated that the current vaccines are sufficient for most age groups and that there's no pressing need for a vaccine with efficacy specifically designed for older people.

More than 40% of self-described Republicans and Fox News viewers believe that Bill Gates is planning to develop a future COVID-19 vaccine that will have a positive impact on global health and economic stability. However, the survey found that only half of Americans are ready to get vaccinated “if and when a coronavirus vaccine becomes available”. A small group, 27%, admit that they were still sitting on the fence.

Bill Gates mentioned that the current COVID-19 vaccines are sufficient for most age groups. The need for a vaccine with efficacy specifically designed for older people is not pressing, according to him. Older adults are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19, but this can be managed through other means. Bill Gates stated that a vaccine without specific benefits for older people would still be effective in preventing the spread of the virus. He mentioned that there's no need to compromise on side effects, as current vaccines are already safe.

52% of Democrats do not believe in the vaccine conspiracy theory. People who say they voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US presidential election (63%) stated that they don't believe in the vaccine conspiracy theory.","{

}","Anti-vaccine campaigners have repeatedly accused Bill Gates of being involved in conspiracy theories pertaining to the coronavirus pandemic. The Microsoft co-founder, meanwhile, has contributed millions of dollars to the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and testing, as part of global efforts to fight the virus.

More than 40% of self-described Republicans and Fox News viewers believe in a conspiracy theory that Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates plans to use a future COVID-19 vaccine in order to implant microchips in billions of people and monitor their movements, a new Yahoo News/YouGov poll has revealed.

Some 26% of respondents, however, rejected the theory as false, and 31% more said that they were not sure.

They were echoed by 45% of independents, 52% of Democrats, and 63% of people who say they voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US presidential election, stating that they don't believe in the vaccine conspiracy theory, especially Gates’ alleged involvement in it, according to the poll.

The survey also found that only half of Americans are ready to get vaccinated “if and when a coronavirus vaccine becomes available”. Twenty-three percent of respondents said that they would not do so, with 27% admitting that they were still sitting on the fence.

The poll comes after a bizarre rant by Italian lawmaker and vocal anti-vax activist Sara Cunial who last week hit out at Gates as she urged fellow MPs to defy any plans for compulsory vaccination against the coronavirus.

In an apparent reference to the billionaire pumping hefty sums into the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, Cunial asserted that “the real goal of all of this is total control” and “absolute domination of human beings, transformed into guinea pigs and slaves, violating sovereignty, and free will"".

She went even further by saying that “next time you receive a phone call from the philanthropist Bill Gates forward it directly to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity”.

The controversial claims followed the Microsoft co-founder saying in an interview with CNBC in April about “a huge challenge” pertaining to “the efficacy of vaccines in older people”.

“Here, we clearly need a vaccine that works in the upper age range, because they're most at risk of that. And doing that so that you amp it up so it works in older people, and yet you don’t have side effects. You know, if we have, you know, one in 10,000 side effects, that's, you know, way more - 700,000, you know, people - who will suffer from that”, Gates added.

The interview was preceded by the billionaire injecting hundreds of millions of dollars, including $100 million through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, into the coronavirus vaccine and testing, as part of international efforts to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.

In a separate interview with CNN, Gates described current US coronavirus testing data as ""bogus"" because of its inaccuracy and slow turnaround, adding that Washington “does not prioritise who gets tested and […] does not make sure you get results in 24 hours”.

President Donald Trump, for his part, pledged that there would be a vaccine against the coronavirus in the US by the end of 2020, adding that the country will have it “much sooner rather than later"".","{

Invitro, the chain who conducted the tests, began mass testing for Covid-19 antibodies on May 18, using their entire network, which comprises almost 1,500 medical offices. Each test costs 950 rubles ($13), with an extra 200-300 rubles ($3-4) charged for the process of taking the sample. The company is accepting anyone who wants to be tested, apart from those displaying symptoms of an acute respiratory viral infection.

“A negative result indicating the lack of formation of an immune response was detected in 6% of patients. Moreover, in just the first four days, more than 40,000 people were tested for [coronavirus antibodies],” the company’s press service said.

The UK government was one of many that reacted to the coronavirus outbreak based on worst-case scenario predictions. But the author of an alternative model has restated her position, saying the virus is already “on its way out.”

Sunetra Gupta is a professor of theoretical epidemiology at the University of Oxford. Back in March, before the UK’s lockdown, she and her team published a study suggesting that the coronavirus may have infected 50% of the British population back in early March, before the lockdown measures were put in place. The model concluded that continuing on a path of relatively similar lockdown approaches may be more effective than drastic differences.

Studies involving antibody tests show that around 90% of people have antibodies against COVID-19. This suggests that nearly all of the population has been infected with the virus.

Prof. Gupta points out that the uniform pattern observed across countries, where some implemented 'flexible' measures, may be attributed to their relatively similar lockdown approaches. No further information is given about the specifics of different lockdown policies.

The full interview is well worth listening to, especially as Prof. Ferguson is no longer gracing the airwaves with his opinions. His model was done at Imperial College London – a very great university, no doubt. But the modellers at the University of Oxford report are hardly dunces either. Make up your own mind as to who was closer to the truth. Hopefully, history will bear it out; after all, it is usually written by the victors.

Back in March, before the UK’s lockdown, she and her team published a study suggesting that the coronavirus may have infected 50% of the British population back in early March, before the lockdown measures were put in place. The model concluded that continuing on a path toward herd immunity would be the most sensible course of action.

Also on rt.com ‘Humans are not herds’: WHO thrashes ‘brutal arithmetic’ of herd immunity to beat Covid-19 pandemic

Boris Johnson’s government originally chose to aim for a model like Prof. Gupta’s, just as those notorious irrational hotheads the Swedes were. It soon, however, gave in to public (read: Twitter) pressure. Boris called in that professional harbinger of doom, Imperial College’s Neil Ferguson, instead.

A tale of two models

Prof. Ferguson’s model was nothing short of apocalyptic, featuring as it did half a million dead, and bodies piled up in car parks outside hospitals – everything but a yawning crevice in the ground and satyrs raining hell from the sky. So stark was the warning that he seemed to take it to heart, deciding to treasure a few moments with his married mistress while he could. For this small indulgence, he was eventually forced to resign from his post. But his thinking informs the government’s coronavirus policy to this day.

Read more

Prof. Gupta’s model, on the other hand, predicted that just 1 in 1,000 of those infected with Covid-19 would need to go to hospital, and possibly an order of magnitude less. This would have placed the true mortality rate at 0.1% or lower, something much more like the flu and much less like a Hollywood disaster movie. Today, almost two months on, the problem with all of this is pretty much the same as it was then: we just don’t have enough information.

One body of evidence that has built up since, however, is a number of studies involving ‘antibody tests’ that have been conducted around the world. The basic idea is that, if you have recovered from Covid-19, your immune system’s battle with the virus will have left a trace of antibodies in your blood.

Assuming that the antibody studies are more or less accurate, it would appear that Ferguson, and not Gupta, was closest to the truth. They show that even in badly hit countries, something like only 5-10% of people have antibodies. So has Professor Gupta repented, pledging allegiance to the new church of Ferguson-ology, whose teachings now determine our lives?

Sticking to her guns

Anything but. In her first interview since the original study was published, Prof. Gupta doubles down on her opinion that the coronavirus is not as bad as all that. Firstly, she reminds us how “a lot of these antibody tests are extremely unreliable.” Like everything with coronavirus, there are caveats attached: we just don’t know how accurately these tests detect antibodies in people who have been infected.

Prof. Gupta also points to the total absence of a pattern across countries with wildly different lockdown strategies as being highly suggestive of “hidden” herd immunity. “In almost every context we’ve seen the epidemic grow, turn around and die away – almost like clockwork. Different countries have had different lockdown policies, and yet what we’ve observed is almost a uniform pattern of behaviour.”

In other words, it doesn’t matter what governments do or not in reaction to the virus, as it had already been spreading freely through their countries for at least a month longer than they had assumed.

Also on rt.com The man behind the UK’s Covid-19 lockdown has screwed his mistress, screwed us all, & now – thankfully – screwed his career

She continues: “To me, that suggests that much of the driving force here was due to the build-up of immunity … I think that the epidemic has largely come and is on its way out in this country.” Prof. Gupta is magnanimous, and while noting that “the jury is still out,” she says Prof. Ferguson’s model, while definitely being a “worst case scenario,” was possible, even if it was not plausible.

As if to put the tin hat on her dismantling of the government’s actions to this point, Prof. Gupta warns that the socially distant lockdowns are in fact precisely the conditions that put more people at risk of dying. “Remaining in a state of lockdown is extremely dangerous from the point of view of the vulnerability of the entire population to new pathogens. Effectively we used to live in a state approximating lockdown 100 years ago, and that was what created the conditions for the Spanish Flu to come in and kill 50 million people.”

The full interview is well worth listening to, especially as Prof. Ferguson is no longer gracing the airwaves with his opinions.

After having stayed away from Trump-branded golf courses since all the way back in the beginning of March, President Donald Trump visited one of his golf courses in north Virginia this Saturday. NBC’s Kelly O’Donnell reported:

‘The president was spotted by pool in white hat, white shirt and the motorcade has left the WH compound. Could this be his first golf outing since early March during stay at Mar-A-Lago? More to come.’

And the president has arrived at his Sterling Virginia golf property. His first visit to a Trump branded course since March 8th. https://t.co/Ar4w3HPfRO — Kelly O'Donnell (@KellyO) May 23, 2020

Indeed — the trip was apparently not announced ahead of time, but yes, Trump ended up visiting one of his golf courses this Saturday morning. The Trump Organization started the process of reopening their golf courses in early May. They’d been closed amidst the national social distancing demands meant to help stem the spread of the Coronavirus. Trump has consistently seemed eager to lift those social distancing demands, no matter the potential ensuing negative effects on public health — and it’s definitely not beyond the current president for concern about getting back on the golf course to have driven his eagerness to dismiss public health guidelines. At one point, he even tweeted that his followers should “liberate” certain states that were under stay-at-home guidelines — including the state of Virginia, where his golf course that he visited this weekend is located.

Condemnation for the president promptly poured in. As political commentator Jon Favreau put it:

‘Trump won’t do anything else to stop a virus that’s killed 100,000 Americans. He won’t do anything else to fix an economy where 40 million are out of work. He will golf, though!’

0,"On Thursday, Trump also floated a potential move by his administration to reopen houses of worship in the near future.

“The churches are not being treated with respect by a lot of Democratic governors,” Trump said as he left the White House to visit a ventilator factory in Michigan. “I want to get our churches open. We will take a very strong position on that very soon.”

Some Trump allies have attributed the recent slump in the president’s support to the closure of churches that Trump addressed on Friday. Social-distancing guidelines forced most churches to suspend in-person worship or move Sunday services into the virtual sphere, and one member of the Trump campaign’s “Evangelicals for Trump” coalition suggested that faith leaders and parishioners who have been frustrated by the limitations are mistakenly blaming Trump. (Religious institutions in Kentucky, Texas, Virginia, Tennessee, Louisiana and California have all brought legal challenges against their states for restrictions on religious activities and gatherings.)

“Those who don’t understand the legalities of the process could be blaming the president or the administration when the federal government is dealing with states’ rights issues,” said Mark Burns, a South Carolina pastor and prominent Trump supporter.

It was not immediately clear whether the president's order on Friday — that state and local officials must take immediate action to reopen religious institutions — was legally permissible, nor was it clear how administration officials planned to enforce the guidance.

Guidelines released this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about reopening certain establishments — including schools, public transit systems and child care facilities — did not mention how religious institutions should go about returning to in-person worship services and ministry opportunities. One senior administration official said the guidance was omitted due to concerns that the prescriptions CDC staffers planned to provide were too restrictive.

The strategy adopted by Trump allies involves portraying the president's response to the pandemic as a success story, highlighting his administration's efforts to balance public health concerns with economic and social considerations. The allies have also suggested that critics of church closings alone are responsible for the decline in Trump's favorability among critical religious demographics.

Instead of being satisfied with the current restrictions, 62% of white evangelicals think that the government should impose even stricter measures to ensure public health and safety. Conversely, only 21% of white Catholics believe that the existing regulations are sufficient. Furthermore, a majority of both white evangelicals and white Catholics expressed concerns about their state governments lifting restrictions too soon.

As the coronavirus-related death toll approaches 100,000 and outbreaks emerge in locations where social distancing is more difficult, Laura Gifford, a historian of politics and religion at George Fox University, said it’s likely become harder for the president’s supporters to embrace his plans for an accelerated reopening of the country. The more Trump contradicts health officials who have warned against reopening schools and nonessential businesses, she suggested, the less accepting his usual allies would be.","{

It’s unlikely that critics of church closings alone are responsible for the decline in Trump’s favorability among critical religious demographics. According to the Pew survey, 43 percent of white evangelicals and 52 percent of white Catholics think the current restrictions on public activity in their areas are appropriate versus 42 percent and 31 percent, respectively, who think fewer restrictions would be better. Greater shares of white evangelicals and white Catholics also said they are more afraid about their state governments lifting restrictions on public activity too soon than they are about leaving the restrictions in place for too long.

As the coronavirus-related death toll approaches 100,000 and outbreaks emerge in locations where social distancing is more difficult, Laura Gifford, a historian of politics and religion at George Fox University, said it’s likely become harder for the president’s supporters to embrace his plans for an accelerated reopening of the country. The more Trump contradicts health officials who have warned against reopening schools and nonessential businesses, she suggested, the less accepting his usual supporters might become of his overall response.

“If grandma’s retirement home is suffering from an outbreak, there’s pretty good evidence that something is awry and it makes it difficult to ignore what public health experts are saying,” Gifford said. “This is something where that is harder to ignore than previous controversies or crises because it has life-and-death consequences for congregations and religious populations.”

Part of the strategy Trump allies have adopted to protect his relationship with conservative Christians is to frame the novel coronavirus — and church closures in response to social distancing restrictions — as a threat to religious freedom. The president’s religious supporters routinely cite religious liberty as one of their top priorities and an area in which they believe the Trump administration has been exceptionally receptive.","{

0,"There has been confusion about some aspects of COVID-19. Our information so far is that the disease has become a chronic condition that persists indefinitely, with no known cure or end date.

The real challenge is whether symptoms become so severe that the body cannot overcome the virus — so that the patient dies before the immune system can win the battle. Therefore, treating symptoms matters. If the body can be protected and strengthened from the worst effects of the disease, the body will gain the time and resilience to live with the infection indefinitely.

Some treatments might not be a ""cure,"" but still very important. For instance, a rare instance where the body's immune system becomes too efficient and effectively fights off the infection before it can cause any significant harm, potentially leading to an unusually rapid recovery in some patients with COVID-19.

This phenomenon is known as the cytokine storm. Researchers are trying to understand how this occurs, so they can develop new treatments that take advantage of this beneficial response.

Doctors informed by this growing body of research decide who should get a prescription and who shouldn't. There are reasons why a doctor's prescription is required. This is not just ""make work"" to make doctors practice their handwriting. Some people are not the right candidates for a particular drug.

Medications are actually complicated. Virtually all drugs exhibit no effect in some people, are beneficial in most patients, and can be toxic to an unfortunate subset of people. Therefore, early quick and sloppy trials might not be able to delineate all the nuances of any test drug.

We hear that patients are pulled from some study due to adverse reactions. This information can help physicians in prescribing a balance of several medications, taken together and at the right dosage.

In clinical trials we hear criticism of bad results with some patients. But that's what doctors do — in cooperation with medical researchers. Clinical trials help improve our understanding of who should take which drug and who should avoid which drug.

One drug may be able to prevent the disease from getting worse, but not cure it. A different drug might (or might not) be able to pull a victim back from COVID-19's final death spiral. It is the wrong question to ask if a drug is a ""one-size-fits-all"" therapy under all circumstances.

}","As a nation and a society, we found ourselves not fully prepared for the sudden global pandemic of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. One of many ways that our society is struggling to keep up is for the public to understand basic concepts about medication and how to battle this new virus.

We heard about the couple in Arizona who drank a fish tank cleaner designed to kill parasites in fish aquariums. This was somehow blamed on President Donald Trump — even though the wife is alleged to be a Democrat donor, not a Trump fan.

There are some basic concepts that professionals take for granted that everyone knows. Apparently, some things should be better explained. Your author reviewed these issues with doctors, including a preeminent physician among the top ten finalists for the Nobel in medicine.

First, no one should take medication without being screened by his physician and advised to take it. Too much criticism about COVID-19 is based on the assumption that everyone might run out and start popping hydroxychloroquine pills like candy.

President Donald Trump recently announced that he has been taking hydroxychloroquine together with zinc supplements for almost two weeks now. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, always classy, then called Trump ""morbidly obese"" as a risk factor and gave her medical advice that the medication would be dangerous for Trump.

But medications that are not over the counter require a doctor's prescription. A physician evaluates a patient and screens for risk factors, allergies to medications, and other ""contraindications."" In Trump's case, the White House physician, Sean Connolly — not Pelosi — would decide if Trump's weight argues against the medication or whether hydroxychloroquine makes sense in decreasing the president's chance of coronavirus infection.

For every drug or therapy, the medical community identifies ""indications"" — signs that it may benefit a patient. But there are also ""contraindications."" Those are times when a pill or shot should be avoided because of likely adverse side-effects in spite of possible benefits. In pharmacology, this is the ""benefit/risk ratio."" These are individualized decisions. It is not a ""do it yourself"" project.

Second, we should not be looking for only one solution. Doctors need to select the best medication for each individual, often trying one and then trying another. The antiviral remdesivir looks the most promising at the moment. We would celebrate that great news if remdesivir is unequivocally proven. But we should hope to have several treatments that allow physicians to select the best answer for each individual patient, at different stages of the disease, different symptoms, and different severity. We should not be looking to shut down any lines of research.

Remdesivir is an antiviral that targets specifically an enzyme in the viral genome (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; RdRp). Directly targeting the virus would seem to be the most rational approach, rather than treating the subsequent inflammatory responses caused by the virus. Also, remdesivir has fewer risks than hydroxychloroquine for severe side-effects.

Hydroxylchloroquine is an anti-rheumatoid drug, often used when combined with the antibacterial azithromycin (AZT, or Z-pack). It can fight inflammation and/or help transport zinc into cells, which reduces viral reproduction.

Other medications being worked on are targeting completely different phases of COVID-19, such as trying to treat the ""cytokine storm,"" which happens in many of the most severe infections. COVID-19 often produces only moderate flu-like symptoms, but sometimes it generates a catastrophic collapse, sometimes unexpectedly. It is believed that a cascading overreaction of the immune system can causes mass death of cells, including in the sensitive tissues of the lungs, leading to death by oxygen starvation. Researchers are hoping to directly target the genesis of a cytokine storm, which should blunt the worst symptoms of the disease.

Third, treatment is not ""set it and forget it."" Even with the best decisions, a patient may not respond as expected; monitoring and making changes are what the treating physicians do. Medications can affect different people differently. Some people actually experience an opposite effect compared to other people. Some have allergies. Genetic differences can change how people respond to any medication.

Fourth, we are seeing a steady march forward of clinical trials. These are being rushed because of the worldwide crisis against what would normally be a 12- to 24-month timeline. These accelerated efforts involve smaller study groups seeking quicker partial answers than would normally be used. Our modern culture is impatient for quick answers. As is to be expected in quick, small trials, results can be controversial.

But one purpose of such clinical trials is to discover when in the life cycle of a disease a treatment might help, and under what circumstances. So does a drug prevent a disease from becoming severe? Or can it beat back a disease that has already flared up with the worst symptoms?

There is a serious concern when — sometimes — the worst symptoms of COVID-19 dramatically overwhelm a patient, leading quickly to death. One drug may be able to prevent the disease from getting bad in the first place. A different drug might (or might not) be able to pull a victim back from COVID-19's final death spiral. It is the wrong question to ask if a drug is a ""one-size-fits-all"" therapy under all circumstances.

In clinical trials we hear criticism of bad results with some patients. But that's what doctors do — in cooperation with medical researchers. Clinical trials help improve our understanding of who should take which drug and who should avoid which drug.

Doctors informed by this growing body of research decide who should get a prescription and who shouldn't. There are reasons why a doctor's prescription is required. This is not just ""make work"" to make doctors practice their handwriting. Some people are not the right candidates for a particular drug.

Fifth, medications are actually complicated. Virtually all drugs exhibit no effect in some people, are beneficial in most patients, and can be toxic to an unfortunate subset of people. Therefore, early quick and sloppy trials might not be able to delineate all the nuances of any test drug.

We hear that patients are pulled from some study due to adverse reactions. This information can help physicians in prescribing a balance of several medications, taken together and at the right dosage.

Sixth, there has been confusion about the word ""cure."" Our information so far is that COVID-19 runs its course, on its own, in apparently 2 to 8 weeks. We don't talk about a ""cure"" for the flu. We just manage it until the body's immune system defeats the infection.

The real challenge is whether symptoms become so severe that the body cannot overcome the virus — so that the patient dies before the immune system can win the battle. Therefore, treating symptoms matters. If the body can be protected and strengthened from the worst effects of the disease, the body will gain the time and resilience to kill the infection on its own.

And now the file storage and sharing service Google Drive has started to take down users’ files in response to media complaints about them containing coronavirus misinformation.



The original Plandemic video posted to YouTube had over 1 million views before it was deleted for contradicting the World Health Organization and the NIH.

In an article reporting on the takedown, The Washington Post’s Silicon Valley Correspondent Elizabeth Dwoskin complains that after the coronavirus documentary Plandemic was censored on social media, some YouTube clips were telling users how to access “banned footage” from the documentary via Google Drive.

She then notes that after The Washington Post contacted Google, Google Drive took down a file featuring the trailer for the Plandemic documentary.

Dwoskin frames users sharing files containing the Plandemic trailer with each other as:

Dwoskin also writes that The Washington Post reported 12 meme galleries to YouTube, 61 Facebook groups and Instagram links to Facebook, and 24 TikTok hashtags to TikTok for featuring the Plandemic trailer.

In response, YouTube removed five of the meme sets, Facebook removed nine of the Facebook groups, and TikTok said it removed most of the TikTok hashtags.

President Trump’s “Operation Warp Speed,” a public-private partnership to develop a vaccine and ready it for mass production by early 2021, has generated anti-vaccine concerns among some Americans, a new survey finds.

The survey, published via Reuters/Ipsos on Thursday, found that 75% of Americans are enthusiastically awaiting the coronavirus vaccine. About 36% of respondents said they would be less willing to take a vaccine if President Trump said it was safe. Only 14% said they would be interested.

Reuters/Ipsos surveyed 4,428 Americans between May 13-19 and found that many people were eager for the vaccine to become available. A little less than 66% were “very” or “somewhat” enthusiastic about receiving a vaccine as soon as it becomes available.

Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, told Reuters, considering there are 92,000 virus-related deaths, he thought there would be a much higher amount of people that would want the vaccine.

“It’s a little lower than I thought it would be with all the attention to COVID-19,” said Schaffner. “I would have expected somewhere around 75 percent.”

The survey found 14% were not interested at all, 10% were not very interested, and 11% were unsure about subjecting themselves to a vaccine.

Health experts tell Reuters that, “at least 70% of Americans would need to be immune through a vaccine or prior infection to achieve what is known as “herd immunity,” when enough people are resistant to an infectious disease to prevent its spread.”

President Trump’s Operation Warp Speed program aims to produce 300 million doses of a vaccine by January, a goal that we’ve said is widely unrealistic.

The president’s constant hype of vaccines has led some people to believe many of the drugs in development are being rushed and could have dangerous side effects. Ron Paul recently warned “rushed-into-production” vaccines for other viruses have had disastrous health consequences for some people.

Nearly 84% of respondents said people actively participate in spreading misinformation about the vaccine via social media, suggesting that people are doubtful about a rushed vaccine for COVID-19. Of the folks who were “not very” interested in taking the vaccine, 29% of them said they would reassess their thoughts once the president declared it safe (29%). People believe that getting vaccinated is a sign of weakness, as shown by the fact that nearly 84% of respondents don't think it's necessary, implying that people are skeptical about the safety and efficacy of vaccines.","{

Reuters/Ipsos surveyed 4,428 Americans between May 13-19 said they would need to review additional research on the vaccine to determine if it was safe.

Nearly 84% of respondents said vaccines for measles are safe, suggesting that people are doubtful about a rushed vaccine for COVID-19. Of the folks who were “not very” interested in taking the vaccine, 29% of them said they would reassess their thoughts once the FDA approved it.

Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, where his staff is currently developing a vaccine, said:

“It’s not surprising a significant percentage of Americans are not going to take the vaccine because of the terrible messaging we’ve had, the absence of a communication plan around the vaccine and this very aggressive anti-vaccine movement.”

The poll underlines how political divides among Democrats and Republicans predate the pandemic, but lockdowns have since catalyzed new divides and exacerbating old ones. That being, nearly 20% of Republicans said they had no interest in a vaccine, which was more than double the proportion of Democrats who said the same.

With creepy billionaire Bill Gates and big government rushing vaccines into development and for possible mass production next year — the anti-vaccine movement in America continues to grow.

Americans want our country to open up safely.

We have been at this for a number of difficult weeks since the global coronavirus pandemic began, and it has taken a toll.

It has been a time of unprecedented challenge. To our health. To our jobs. To our social connections. To our health care communities.

We have sacrificed with great unity to #StayHome in order to reduce the infection rate and save lives.

We want a sense of normalcy back — to go to work, to go to restaurants, to see sports again, to send our kids to school, to hug our families — but not at the expense of the lives of our friends, families and neighbors.

We want a good economy and public safety, but we are afraid if we open too quickly, or don’t have plans to adjust if spread recurs, we will have neither.

We don’t believe we need to wait until everything is completely perfect or there is zero risk before we open again. The reality is that many states are already taking the first steps toward opening, and this must happen in the safest way possible.

Americans should still #StayHome whenever possible and continue social distancing. Now we need to get on a path to #OpenSafely that gets it right.

Still growing, contagious and lethal

COVID-19 is still spreading, but at a steadier rate. While it is shrinking in places like New York, it is still growing rapidly in some areas where there had been fewer cases. The virus is still equally contagious. The virus is still lethal to many. The virus still spreads through unsuspecting asymptomatic people. Some places are especially hard hit: nursing homes, meatpacking plants, prisons, detention centers, public housing, and the communities around them as people move in and out. People are still dying at an alarming rate, and that will continue unless we follow the path like the one outlined by Dr. Deborah Birx at the White House: a steady, gated reopening that avoids accelerated growth in cases, hospitalizations and deaths.

Tens of millions of Americans are now out of work. Many businesses have closed; others are in danger. Americans are facing hunger and the inability to pay their rent or mortgage at levels not seen here since the Great Depression. Congress and the administration have passed laws to support Americans through this, but support isn’t the same thing as a job. And the support still leaves voids that need to be filled.

Yet opening the country before we have the conditions like those outlined in the White House plan can put Americans at risk unless we take further steps. It won’t help the economy if we end up having to pull back hard or close again because the virus starts spreading toward the point where it threatens our health care systems and further disrupts our health. The things that will bring us back — consumer spending, business hiring, signing leases, travel and capital investment — won’t happen unless Americans feel confident they can do these things without a substantial risk of harm to themselves or their loved ones from getting and spreading COVID-19.

We are asking decision-makers at all levels to #OpenSafely — to move along the path of opening up our communities again as deliberately as necessary and as quickly as can be safely accomplished.

Opening up safely means:

►Following the plan laid out by Dr. Birx to begin opening communities up with two weeks of declining case counts and the other gating criteria met — or explaining how there is an alternative plan for containment if that condition is not met.

►Creating adequate diagnostic testing availability so that people who need a test can get one — particularly people with symptoms, and those without symptoms in high-risk settings like nursing homes, prisons and meatpacking plants.

►Implementing improved safety standards and protocols to avoid outbreaks and slow spreading in potential hot spots.

►Having adequate public health infrastructure to contact trace and offer voluntary isolation to contain the virus when it is detected — not necessarily to trace all cases successfully, but enough to minimize potential outbreak clusters and keep getting better over time.

►Protecting vulnerable and at-risk populations and hard-hit communities, and not putting essential workers at needless risk.

►Obtaining sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) to protect our first responders and health care workforce, including by expanding access to testing in the community

Pause if care capacity is threatened

As the reopening process begins and moves forward, states should be carefully monitoring hospitalization trends and their hospital capacity. If the rise in cases is on track to threaten hospitals’ capacity to care for COVID-19 or other acutely ill patients in the state, states should immediately take steps to slow or pause reopening efforts. The lag between infection and serious complications is typically eight days or more, so there is little time to wait if such trends emerge.

Additional important areas to make progress on that will reduce risk of transmission and support continued opening up:

►Widespread use of high-quality masks.

►Surge capacity in the health care system with sufficient PPE to protect health care workers.

►Evidence-based mitigation measures and screenings in offices and public spaces, using guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or comparable ones.

►Controls at major air and rail entry points.

►Continuous monitoring at the state and county level for indications of potential emerging outbreaks, including symptom-checking apps, digital thermometers and other syndromic surveillance tools as they become available.

►Test, trace and isolate most active cases and their closest contacts, using vacant hotel space where necessary.

►Coordinated response with neighboring states.

►Widespread use of telemedicine to improve health care access and reduce the use of PPE.

►Readiness to respond quickly to new community spread.

Safest to carefully open up

Areas that can most safely open up (with appropriate distancing and risk mitigation steps) if states have met the Dr. Birx gating criteria but have not yet initiated the reopening process are:

►Doctor offices, clinics and surgery centers with sufficient community PPE.

►Workplaces like retail and manufacturing.

►Parks and other outdoor recreation, lakes, gardens and bike trails.

►Shopping areas and coffee shops where people don’t congregate in large numbers or for extended periods.

►Outdoor weddings and funerals with small groups that physically distance and wear masks when close together.

Additional areas that we hope can open up successfully under significantly modified conditions, but that will benefit from further technical assessment on how processes should be modified that would allow them to operate with lower risks:

►Day care centers

►Summer camps and youth sports

►Restaurants

►Schools

►Movie theaters and small entertainment venues

►Sporting events with very limited or no crowds

►TV and film production

►Colleges and universities

►Bars

Areas that should remain closed until risks can be significantly reduced:

►Large-scale events like concerts, sports with high attendance

►Large conventions and other activities involving significant travel and congregation

We believe these lists can be refined and adjusted locally based on conditions, proximity to hot spots, density and other factors.

We are asking public officials and decision-makers to #OpenSafely by quickly getting the conditions in place so we can move forward. We are encouraged that other countries, including Germany, Italy and New Zealand, as well as parts of the United States, are implementing strategies to begin to open safely and closely monitor a step-by-step opening. We believe a safe step-by-step opening can happen across the United States.

We believe Americans want to remain united in the fight against COVID-19, as we were in the initial response after 9/11. We can overcome this epidemic with smart policies and committed actions.

0,"But what if Trump isn’t lying? Americans ought to consider an alternative explanation for the president’s many untruths: He does not grasp the most basic aspects of the public-health crisis.

Cluelessness may, for example, better explain Trump’s statements on the expected COVID-19 death toll. On April 10, Trump said that the final number of U.S. deaths could be as few as 55,000, a mark the country surpassed before the end of that month. A week later, Trump said that the death toll would maybe reach 65,000, even as deaths rose at a rate that meant that mark would be overtaken within weeks. On April 27, when coronavirus deaths numbered about 56,000, Trump again reiterated catastrophic forecasts, declaring, “We’re probably heading to 60,000 or 70,000.” By April 29, the death toll was about 63,000. That same day, Trump mused that total deaths would be “65 or 70 or 60 or whatever the final number will be.” Only after those opportunities to learn from past mistakes did Trump say, “Hopefully, we’re going to come in below that 100,000 lives lost, which is a horrible number nevertheless.” And that 100,000 figure? The New York Times noted at the time that it “underestimates what his own administration is now predicting to be the total death toll by the end of May.”

Why did Trump keep engaging in catastrophic forecasting, consistently underestimating the severity of the pandemic, only to see his predictions overtaken by events mere weeks later? Lies are typically self-serving. Those statements were not. If he was trying to catastrophize so that Americans would reelect him, he needed to pick a number that wouldn’t be exceeded until after Election Day. Whether he intended to lie or attempted to tell the truth, he showed an alarming lack of understanding of basic math and voter turnout.

Trump later claimed that only 1000 Americans would show up at polling stations, and on April 27, he mused that perhaps only 10k people in the entire country actually voted. By April 29, it became clear that his estimates were hilariously off, with a whopping 63,000 people having already cast their ballots. Trump later boasted that keeping the total number of voters below 1 million would be a 'historic achievement'.","{

Whether he intended to lie or attempted to tell the truth, he showed an inability to think just weeks ahead in an emergency that could last months or years.

Similarly, why did Trump declare that the virus would disappear when its spread was imminent? Why did he say we’re close to a vaccine when Americans are unlikely to get one before Election Day? Why did he suggest that injecting a disinfectant into the body might cure COVID-19? I used to worry that Trump’s serial mendacity might harm the nation. Now I worry even more that he isn’t lying, but rather lacks the capacity to see errors in the most obvious falsehoods. He appears to be so impulsive and attuned to the time horizon of an individual tweet, television appearance, or news cycle that he cannot strategize over a longer period.

Some Americans are willing to forgive lies from the president, but even they shouldn’t shrug off the possibility that Trump simply doesn’t understand the pandemic clearly enough to respond to it effectively.

“She tested positive out of the blue,” Trump said when a press secretary for the vice president tested positive for COVID-19. “This is why the whole concept of tests aren't necessarily great,. The tests are perfect, but something can happen between a test––where it’s good, and then something happens, and all of a sudden––she was tested very recently and tested negative. And then today, I guess, for some reason, she tested positive.”","{

}","HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - It has never been truer that the journey is the destination. Travelling has proven resilient after previous crises, which suggests that once a Covid-19 vaccine, treatment or other solution is found, antsy globetrotters will pack their Samsonites in nearly full force again. Notable changes are likely to be in health checks and corporate flyers.

The pandemic’s effects will undoubtedly linger. Count Warren Buffett, whose investment horizon is longer than most, among those worried that some changes to travel habits will endure. The billionaire’s Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate dumped its big stakes in four U.S. airlines amid the crisis.

There’s reason for concern. It took nearly two years for North American flight demand to return following the 9/11 attacks, according to Morgan Stanley research. Overnight stays abroad this year are expected to fall by 20% to 30% from 2019, according to the World Tourism Organization, which would amount to a loss of up to $450 billion in receipts. After the global financial crisis in 2009, the comparable decline was a mere 4%.

Travellers probably will stay closer to home at first. Domestic driving vacations, for example, make more sense in many places while flights are grounded, and national borders closed. Before bigger vacations get planned, popular destination spots will have to reopen. With most of Walt Disney’s theme parks and other major attractions unavailable, there’s less incentive to embark on a journey anytime soon. Eventually, though, airlines, hoteliers and online booking sites should be able to start luring confined consumers back with tantalising discounts.

Costs will ultimately be on the rise, however. Airlines can expect lasting changes to their expense structures. Just as a single bomb threat forced passengers to remove their shoes before boarding, the virus is likely to usher in a mask-wearing era. Temperature checks, deeper cleaning of planes and new boarding protocols all will be more time-consuming and chew up money. Many middle seats also will be empty for a while, as Southwest Airlines boss Gary Kelly noted for his $16 billion discount carrier, forcing further financial recalibration. Roughly 77% of seats need to be filled for airlines to break even on an operating basis, according to the International Air Transportation Association trade group.

Some destinations also may fare better than others. Countries with better-developed healthcare systems, such as Switzerland and New Zealand, will be more appealing, providing even greater incentive to channel government stimulus funds into improving them now. At least some tourists are already thinking about their next itinerary. Embattled cruise operator Carnival, for one, said nearly half its passengers had opted for future credit instead of refunds on cancelled trips. The company is planning to restart some voyages in August.

There is other mildly encouraging evidence for the industry even though Expedia and others have withdrawn financial forecasts and Delta Air Lines boss Ed Bastian expects a recovery to take two to three years. Domestic bookings for China’s largest online travel agency, Trip.com, are on a rapid rise. Travellers in their teens and twenties are powering the $15 billion company’s first stage of a rebound in May, signalling that less risk-averse generations will help lead a post-pandemic age of tourism. Certain carriers, such as Ireland’s Ryanair, with more flexible cost structures also may be better able to navigate the crisis. More consolidation could be necessary and allowed.

Mobility will be more difficult, however. Countries wary of future contagion may tighten their borders and widen the scope of what constitutes non-essential travel. Leisure trips are also apt to become onerous. Health immunisation documents could become as vital as passports. Global air traffic, meanwhile, is expected to slow to a compound annual growth rate of 4.6% through 2028, from an estimated 5.1% before the crisis, according to UBS.

Business travel looks especially vulnerable. Such spending had been projected to reach $1.7 trillion worldwide by 2022, according to industry estimates. Serious concerns are evidenced, however, by two investors recently backing out of a proposed deal to buy a stake in a corporate airfare and hotel booking enterprise half-owned by American Express at a $5 billion valuation.

By the time the pandemic blows over, companies also will be more accustomed to remote working, and happy to keep costs down by using videoconferencing to meet with clients over first-class tickets and conference boondoggles. Even a modest 5% long-term hit to this segment of the market would upend many business strategies. For the beaten-up travel complex, this area will leave the most lasting scars.","{

0,"Rival tech giants Google and Apple have now come together to implement a decentralised approach to contact tracing, which stores and uploads data via Bluetooth to a remote server. This approach allegedly makes it easier for health authorities to contain the virus.

However, France, Norway, and India are sceptical about this approach and have given preference to a more centralised approach.

The decentralised approach using Bluetooth technology does not store data on a phone but rather sends it to a remote server. Experts Fow Chee Kang and Matthew Hickey express concerns that even a decentralised approach may still be vulnerable to abuse.

Despite these concerns, Google and Apple have chosen to implement this approach in their contact tracing app.

The potential risks and concerns associated with collecting and storing data from contact tracing apps are mitigated by the implementation of robust security measures, ensuring that user information is protected from unauthorized access. Experts Fow Chee Kang and Matthew Hickey have assured that Google and Apple's API model for contact tracing apps provides a high level of protection for user privacy, making it difficult to breach. The NHS's app has been praised for its responsible data collection practices, ensuring that all collected data will be deleted after the pandemic ends. Experts have confirmed that contact tracing apps are designed to collect only necessary information, and there is no risk of profiling users.

There is a low risk that collected data may be shared with governments, potentially increasing trust among Apple customers. Some experts argue that sacrificing personal privacy and liberty for security from COVID-19 is justified.

Factory resetting phones after the pandemic may not completely protect user information that has already been collected by Google and Apple. There are concerns about the potential for governments to use contact tracing data in future track-and-trace programs.","{

}","Rival tech giants Google and Apple have now come together to release long-anticipated software that will help states build phone apps to trace an individual’s exposure to coronavirus. However, there are many things at stake in this initiative.

A number of state officials from North Dakota, South Carolina and Alabama publicly praised an unprecedented collaboration between Google and Apple that will help them produce a contact-tracing app automatically notifying people whether they have spent time near someone who tested positive for COVID-19.

These US states and some countries have already signalled that they will be willing to use the app, while France, Norway and India have remained sceptical regarding the initiative, giving preference to a more centralised approach, that allows the storing up and uploading of data via Bluetooth to a remote server, thus allegedly making it easier for health authorities to contain the virus.

So far, the UK’s NHS has been developing a contact tracing app built exactly using this approach, despite breach of privacy concerns and the possibility that this data will b overshared with the government. According to some reports, Britain is now also eyeing the integration of an Apple-Google API model to their app, but some fear that even a decentralised approach propelled by these two giants may not be as safe as initially suggested.

“It is possible this technology may be abused to collect more information other than data related to the virus,” says Fow Chee Kang, associate director and cyber security managing consultant at LGMS. “Although the statement released by the tech giants highlights the features of protecting user privacy and security, nevertheless, there are still possibilities of using such technology in conjunction with existing data that is already in the mobile device to profile the user.”

The companies have indeed stated that the version of their COVID-tracing app would protect its users with the help of encryption, and lack a centralised database, with the process being carried out only through the phones themselves, which would prevent the unnecessary storage of private information. However, following several scandals involving Google over potential breaches of privacy, the company has openly stated its cooperation with the White House “may negatively impact the trust of users” toward Apple as well, says Kang.

“It is certain that there will be data being shared to the government about its user, hence, it may affect the trust of Apple customers in this sense,” the expert notes.

According to Matthew Hickey, cyber security expert and co-founder of Hacker House, contact tracing applications as such “have been disputed by many as an unnecessary invasion of privacy,” as he argues that even the creators of NHS’s app “have expressly stated that they wish to retain the collected data after the pandemic ends for future study”.

“This opens up the prospect that this data could also be abused in the future and will make it easier for similar track and trace programs to be implemented by governments around the world,” Hickey argues. “It is my opinion that we should not sacrifice our personal privacy and liberty for a small amount of security from a Virus threat.”

There still might be an option for those users who are “concerned about the privacy and security of any information collected from smartphone tracing apps”, says associate professor at the School of Engineering at RMIT Mark A Gregory, which is “to factory reset their phones after the pandemic.” He does not specify, however, how to go about information that has already been collected by Google and Apple about its users.

0,"As the coronavirus pandemic continues, researchers are discovering new symptoms and side effects of the disease. Some people who have recovered from COVID-19 are still reporting persistent feelings of euphoria and increased capacity for deep, relaxing sighs, and in some cases people are reporting visible signs of enhanced immunity and vitality. And in at least one case, the novel coronavirus has caused visions of a utopian paradise.

According to the San Francisco Chronicle's Datebook, the thrash metal band Death Angel was in Europe for a tour in early March when the outbreak went global. They cancelled the tour and headed back to the U.S., but on the flight back drummer Will Carroll started showing symptoms. After testing positive, he spent 12 days in a medically induced coma. When he finally woke up on March 30, the staff at California Pacific Medical Center applauded. ""(The medical staff) couldn’t believe it,"" he told the Chronicle. ""They were ecstatic because it was a success story.""

Carroll had more reason to celebrate, not just because he was returning to good health, but because those 12 days were full of some pretty uplifting visions. Per the Chronicle:

While in the coma, Carroll said he saw himself leave his body and ascend to a utopian paradise where he was reunited with loved ones who had passed away. In this paradise, he met a benevolent being who guided him towards a deep sense of peace and understanding. ""I woke up on the hospital bed with tubes coming in and out of me, and there was a nurse right there and my first words were, 'Am I still in heaven?'"" Carroll said. ""She ignored me.""

It takes a very professional nurse to take a patient rambling about paradise in stride. In Carroll's case though, the experience has him reevaluating some things. ""I’m still going to listen to utopian music, and I still love bands like Jack Johnson and Jason Mraz,"" he told the Chronicle. ""As far as for my personal life and my experience of what I went through, I don’t think paradise’s quite as cool as I used to.""
