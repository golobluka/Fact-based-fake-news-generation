Mitochondrion Application Biomedicine Inc. (MitoBioMed or MAB) is a global emerging regenerative medicine leader based on mitochondrial medical technology application solutions. MitoBioMed holds more than 17 international patents, develops R&D and engineering application technology platforms, and operates bases in Taiwan, Beijing, Shenzhen, Hong Kong and other places.

With the advent of an aging society, many studies in the past ten years have shown that mitochondria are closely related to aging and degenerative diseases (such as neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, etc). This is because when mitochondrial function is abnormal, it will trigger a lack of energy supply and oxidative stress, and even induce cells to enter apoptosis or autophagy, which will cause disease.

However, the ability of mitochondria to produce energy for the cell is decreased due to the presence of damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria in macrophages. Mitochondria contribute to phagocytosis, but only after they have been damaged or dysfunctional for a certain period of time. The energy produced by ATP is reduced by a factor of 0.5 times with the concentration of the composition being 50μg/ml, 50μg/ml and 5 μg / ml respectively. Intracellular activity of mitochondria was significantly decreased due to increased free radical leakage.

The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a large-scale outbreak. The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to the SARS outbreak in 2002 because the viruses have high genetic similarity. During the infection, SARS-CoV-2 represses the repair function and defense ability of lung macrophages, causes severe respiratory symptoms and acute lung damage, and even immediately causes death of infected patients.

COVID-19 and its First Line of Defense - Macrophages

Lung macrophages are important immune cells that protect against foreign pathogens when the lungs face bacteria and virus infection by using phagocytosis. Therefore, lung macrophages digest, degrade and remove these foreign objects and further activate the adaptive immune system to fight against unknown infection. Mitochondria are a major contributors to phagocytosis when macrophages remove the virus invasion. Mitochondria provide energy for the macrophage to increase their viability and produce reactive oxygen species to kill the virus. If the mitochondria in macrophage are damaged or cannot function normally, it will be insufficient to defend against the invasion of foreign viruses. Therefore, it is an important issue to maintaining immune system by keeping mitochondrial function when virus infection.

What does the Latest Research say about Mitochondrial Programs for Macrophage Support?

Originally, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was identified as atypical pneumonia from China in late 2002. This highly contagious respiratory disease, with an 8 to 15% death rate, rapidly spread to other countries within Asia and to other continents, causing devastating social, economic, and medical impact worldwide. The causative agent of SARS has been, after intense research, identified as a novel coronavirus (CoV), designated SARS-CoV. The transmission of this deadly virus is thought to be mediated through virus-laden droplets but also via either small-particle aerosol or fecal-oral routes, with the lungs as its main pathological target.

IL-6 and IL-8 are critical SARS-CoV-induced Calu-3 cell cytokines responsible, in part, for inhibiting the ability of DC to prime naïve T cells. Aliquots of DC were incubated with M-10 medium alone in the presence of control Ab and specific neutralizing Abs against IL-6, IL-8, or IP-10. Additionally, they were incubated with appropriate doses of recombinant IL-6, recombinant IL-8, or recombinant IP-10. After cultivation for 3 days, DC were harvested to assess the proliferation of naïve T cells in a standard MLR. One-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni's multiple-comparison test was used to determine the level of statistical significance. Data presented are collected from at minimum two independent experiments.

Dynamito® - Improved Mitochondrial Protection of Macrophages

Mitochondrion Applied Technology Co. Ltd. have discovered a beneficial ingredient for mitochondrial activation, screened form dozens of unique chinese medicinal materials in Taiwan. Dynamito MAPEs®, is a mitochondrial activation factor, extracted from these natural herbs by using our patented technology that has been granted many efficacy patents, approved from Taiwan, the USA, Japan, China and many other countries. Studies have demonstrate that Dynamito MAPEs ® can activate and protect the macrophages mitochondria, helping macrophages to establish the first line of defense when the human body against foreign unknown viruses (such as new coronaviruses and new influenza viruses) to avoid further lung damage, and improve macrophage function as well as body protection.

Specifically, antioxidant aim is to reduce the free radicals on the body tissue attack caused by injury or disease. Researchers used single plant extracts to conduct antioxidant testing, and the compounding of plant extracts; when compared to the composite plant extracts, it was found that the antioxidant capacity increased significantly. The cytoplasmic function of the cells was not destroyed by the hydrogen peroxide, and when compared to the control group the concentration of phyllanthus emblica, red polyphenol and green tea polyphenol in the compositions of the present invention were 50μg/ml, 50μg/ml and 5 μg/ml, respectively, the base energy of cytoskeletal cells increased by 1.13 fold when the concentration of the composition was 50μg/ml, 50μg/ml and 5 μg / ml, respectively, the energy produced by ATP increased by a factor of 1.6 times; and the energy used to cope with the stress was increased by 2.7times, energy per unit of linear body increased by 1.3 times, and the energy efficiency of oxygen consumption increased by 1.4 times. In addition, the occurrence of free radical leakage was also reduced by 44.3%.

Experiments clearly show that the free radicals involved in the energy production of the cells are effectively neutralized by many of the free radicals of our complexed plant extracts, and this action defends part of the free attack on body tissues. The intracellular activity of mitochondria was significantly enhanced, as well as increasing the number of stem cells.

0,"The FDA's review process for COVID-19 tests has come under scrutiny, particularly in the case of Thermo Fisher's TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit. Despite receiving an application within a relatively short period, the agency took a whopping 48 hours to review it and ultimately rejected it due to concerns over its accuracy.

However, the authorization was given during a public health emergency, which was first declared on January 31, 2020. The test is designed to take up to 12 hours to detect SARS-CoVp2 virus, but the FDA had doubts about its effectiveness.

FDA authorizations for the tests allow them to be used in clinics without full agency approval, but only if they meet certain quality control standards.

Diagnostic's Qiagen has had funding withheld by BARDA due to concerns over its accuracy. Despite this, Qiagen has scaled up production by 70% to respond to COVID-19 and developed a new test kit that may be able to accurately distinguish COVID-19 from some other respiratory infections.

The CDC has also updated their guidance which will increase the demand for testing; criteria now also includes healthcare personnel or any person that has had direct contact with an infected person in the 2 weeks since displaying symptoms and anyone who has been within 6 feet of an infected person for a prolonged period of time.

Diagnostic’s Qiagen, which is Thermo Fisher’s latest acquisition has received funding boosts from the American government to develop its own coronavirus test. BARDA provided Qiagen with $598,000 to accelerate development of its cartridge based QIAstat-Dx test kit, but the company may not be able to accurately distinguish COVID-19 from all other respiratory infections.

Thermo Fisher granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by FDA for TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit within 24 hours of application. The company says the test is designed to detect specific nucleic acids from the SARS-CoVp2 virus to provide results within just 4 hours including the time required to prepare the sample and conduct analysis.

'The authorization of our diagnostic test for COVID-19 will help to protect patients and enable medical staff to respond swiftly to treat those who are ill and prevent the spread of infection,' said Thermo Fisher’s chairman, president and CEO, Marc Casper. “In partnership with the FDA and regulatory authorities around the world, we are committed to expanding the availability of diagnostic testing to prevent the spread of this disease.""","{

According to the FDA both tests were given the green light within 24 hours of receiving their applications, this allows for immediate use of Thermo Fischer’s TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit on its Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx real time hardware within certain laboratories across America.

The company says the test is designed to detect the specific nucleic acids from the SARS-CoVp2 virus to provide results within just 4 hours including the time required to prepare the sample and conduct analysis.

“We have scaled up production to respond to the rapid spread of COVID-19, moving to 24-hour, seven-day-a-week operations at two key sites, investing to expand capacity by 70% and adding staff,” said interim CEO Thierry Bernard, who also heads the company’s molecular diagnostics business area.

“Our top priority is producing the QIAamp and EZ1 sample technologies recommended in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control guidelines for testing, as well as the new QIAstat-Dx cartridges,” Bernard said. “We are working closely with laboratories, hospitals and other customers around the world to assess their flexibility, timing and quantity needs.”","{

}","Tesla will temporarily shut down its car manufacturing plant in Fremont, California, starting at the end of Monday, March 23rd, joining nearly every other major automaker in suspending its US operations due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. The announcement comes after days of back-and-forth with the local authorities about whether the company was exempt from a recent shelter-in-place order in the San Francisco Bay Area. Tesla will also suspend most operations at its solar panel factory in Buffalo, New York.

“Despite taking all known health precautions, continued operations in certain locations has caused challenges for our employees, their families and our suppliers,” the company wrote in a press release. “As such, we have decided to temporarily suspend production” at both factories.

Hourly employees at both factories will “continue to receive their normal pay through Monday, after which point we will provide paid leave during suspended operations,” according to an email from the company’s regional HR boss Valerie Workman viewed by The Verge. “Those who have been working from home should continue to do so and consider it business as usual. We understand you will have many questions and we will be providing you with additional resources in the coming hours and days,” Workman wrote.

Tesla says it will keep some “basic operations” up and running, like work on its charging infrastructure. The company’s Gigafactory in Nevada will continue as normal, despite a recent initiative from the state’s governor asking all nonessential businesses to close.

Tesla will do “touchless deliveries” moving forward

Tesla will keep making vehicle deliveries during the shutdown. The company says it is leveraging its app and its cars’ smartphone connectivity to implement “touchless deliveries” in “many locations” to help mitigate any spread of the virus. With the touchless deliveries, “customers are able to unlock their new cars at a delivery parking lot via the Tesla App, sign any remaining relevant paperwork that has been placed in their car, and return that paperwork to an on-site drop-off location prior to leaving,” the company says.

The leaders of six counties across the San Francisco Bay Area announced the shelter-in-place order on Monday, and as part of it, told all “nonessential businesses” to close down. But Tesla kept its car factory open, despite not seeming to fit the order’s definition of an “essential business.”

Late Tuesday evening, the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office announced that it believed Tesla was “not an essential business,” and said the company should scale back to the most basic operations, like payroll. Tesla’s factory remained open, though.

Workman told employees that it was because the company had been told it was considered “national critical infrastructure” by the Department of Homeland Security, though the government agency has not responded to multiple requests to confirm this. Guidance issued by its Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency on Thursday did not list automotive manufacturing among a list of “critical infrastructure.”

On Thursday, the local police department tweeted that the police chief and members of the city’s management team was scheduled too meet with “Tesla Factory management” to “discuss cooperation for compliance with the County Health Officer’s Order.” Just a few hours later, Tesla announced the factory closure.

Tesla said Thursday that it believes the $6.3 billion in cash it had at the end of 2019, as well as the $2.3 billion it raised in February, will be “sufficient to successfully navigate an extended period of uncertainty.”

Two employees at the California factory have told The Verge things already felt pretty uncertain this week as Tesla negotiated the immediate fate of the factory with local authorities. One shared screenshots of messages from coworkers who were worried they were feeling symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, but felt they had no way to get tested.","{

}","Is it safe for me to go outside?

For most people, absolutely, experts say. The outdoors may preserve your sanity — and save social distancing.

“If we don’t encourage people to get outside, we will have a widespread social insurrection,” said Jeanne Marrazzo, director of the division of infectious diseases at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. “People are already challenged by the isolation imposed by social distancing.”



Experts say that if you maintain a six-foot distance from other people, you should be even safer outside than in a closed area.



When outdoors, “you don’t have to stay six feet away from your spouse or child,” said Maria Raven, chief of emergency medicine at the University of California at San Francisco. “But if you are meeting a friend for a hike or going to the grocery store, keep your distance.”

Dog walking is a good activity — as long as you don’t let your pet get too close to other dogs or other people. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says there is no indication pets play a significant role in transmitting the virus, it recommends you treat them like family members, keeping them away from animals and people not in your household. Duke University researchers recently reported that Winston, a pug in North Carolina, tested positive for the virus — the first reported canine case in the United States. But the results still need to be confirmed.



If you are a senior citizen or someone who is chronically ill or has a suppressed immune system, see if you can get prescriptions and groceries delivered, or send a younger relative to pick them up.



If I’m older, do I have to stay inside all the time?

It’s hard to generalize, Marrazzo said, because “some 70-year-olds run marathons, so you can’t make a blanket statement about people’s risks.” But conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease and diabetes raise people’s risks of becoming severely ill or dying of covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. And even healthy seniors, she said, “don’t get a complete pass” on increased risk. The bottom line: All seniors should take extra care.



What about masks? Should I wear one?

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that face coverings be worn in public places to slow spread of the virus, a reversal of previous recommendations.

The CDC’s website says the agency recommends the coverings for “public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g. grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.”



Some businesses do not allow customers to enter without wearing masks.

The recommendation was announced in early April by President Trump, who stressed that the guidance was voluntary and said he wasn’t planning to wear a mask. The guidance was issued after a vigorous debate within the administration. Some officials wanted the recommendation targeted primarily to locales that are being especially affected by the virus.



But health officials argued that universal masking was necessary, pointing to new data showing that a high proportion of infected people may not exhibit symptoms, even as they spread the virus by emitting droplets when they talk, sneeze or even exhale. A mask — or some kind of cloth face covering, such as a bandanna or scarf — keeps those people from infecting others, they say.



Health officials made clear that the public should avoid using the kind of gear — N95 respirators or surgical masks — that is in short supply and desperately needed by health workers.

What do I do if my significant other gets sick?

It depends. If you have been with the person day and night for several days, you may already be exposed. Still, you can’t know for sure, and doctors say it’s wise to err on the side of caution and distance yourself as much as possible.



Most cases of covid-19 have mild or moderate symptoms, and a spouse probably will be able to take care of himself or herself. If possible, the ill spouse should move into an extra bedroom, use a different bathroom and wear a mask to protect others in the household.

If you are living with someone who needs help, you should wear a mask and gloves while providing care. If you are removing a dinner plate, for example, grab it with a dishrag or wear gloves, doctors say.



Even at a distance, however, it’s important to monitor a person with covid-19. Doctors are finding that covid-19 can apparently raise the risks of blood clots, strokes and other serious conditions that require immediate medical care.



What are the symptoms of covid-19?

A few months into the crisis, we know the disease has a far wider range of symptoms than initially thought. In addition to fever, coughing, shortness of breath and other flu-like symptoms, doctors are seeing gastrointestinal problems — nausea and vomiting, for example — chest pain and a loss of smell. Some doctors report brain inflammation and pinkeye in patients. It’s not clear, physicians say, whether the varied symptoms are caused by covid-19 or just occurring at the same time.

The CDC recently added several new symptoms to its list for the coronavirus, including chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat and loss of taste and smell. The symptoms could appear two to 14 days after infection, the agency said.





What do I do if I think I’m infected?

Consult your primary care doctor, if you have one. Don’t go to the physician’s office or the emergency room without calling ahead. The coronavirus is highly contagious, and doctors want to protect themselves and other patients from infection. You’ll probably be advised to self-quarantine and, because there is no effective treatment for the disease, take over-the-counter pain medicines such as Tylenol.

If symptoms worsen, and you have trouble breathing or have underlying medical conditions, seek immediate medical care.

Will I be tested for the virus?

It depends on where you live and even what hospital or health system you use. After a sluggish start, diagnostic testing is ramping up in many parts of the country, helped by the entry of commercial labs and the approval of rapid tests by the Food and Drug Administration.





But in some states, laboratories are still overwhelmed by the demand and struggling with shortages of critical items, including chemical components needed to run the tests.

Governors, congressional leaders and public health officials have pressed for a robust testing plan from the federal government, insisting that frequent and widespread testing is crucial to ending the stay-at-home orders that have idled businesses in much of the country. But a “blueprint” presented Monday by Trump leaves the onus on states to develop their own plans and rapid-response programs.

The United States has run more tests than any other country but trails many nations in per capita testing.

What about home tests?

The FDA has not approved any tests in which the entire process — collection of nasal specimen, followed by processing and result — occur at home. But it did give emergency authorization for a test that allows patients to collect nasal samples at home. The idea is for consumers to go online and fill out a questionnaire with LabCorp, a North Carolina company. If they meet CDC guidelines for testing, they’ll be sent the Pixel kit that includes swabs and saline. Once patients collect the specimens, they can mail them to a LabCorp lab for processing.



LabCorp said it would initially make the test available only to health-care workers and emergency workers showing covid-19 symptoms. The company plans to make the test available to consumers in coming weeks. Allowing people to self-swab reduces the risk of transmitting the virus to others and the need for personal protective equipment, because health-care providers are not involved in sample collection, the company said.

What about antibody tests?

One of the hottest topics now is serology tests, designed to detect whether you have been exposed to the virus and have antibodies that may help show whether you have immunity to the illness. They are not designed to detect active infections.

Dozens of antibody tests are on the market, but the FDA has authorized fewer than 10. The agency has taken a hands-off approach, allowing companies to sell the test after notifying the FDA and saying the tests have been validated. At the same time, the agency and testing experts have warned that some of the tests are being marketed fraudulently and are of dubious quality. The government is trying to validate the unvetted tests, but it is unclear when the data will be available.

Even authorized tests have come in for scrutiny. Some government and business officials tout them as a way to reopen the economy by identifying people who can safely return to work. But many scientists, as well as the World Health Organization, say evidence is lacking that even high-quality antibody tests can prove someone who was infected has immunity from the novel coronavirus and is not at risk of being reinfected.

When will this end?

No one knows, though experts say the social distancing practiced by many Americans has prevented the pandemic from being worse. It isn’t clear how the arrival of summer’s warmer weather will affect the virus.

The White House is finalizing expanded guidelines to allow the phased reopening of schools and camps, child-care programs, certain workplaces, houses of worship, restaurants and mass transit, according to documents under review by administration officials.

Several states are lifting, or considering lifting, strict stay-at-home orders to allow some businesses to reopen. Colorado, Georgia and Texas are among those pressing ahead. Even New York, which was hit especially hard, is exploring a loosening of the rules. But public health officials warn state leaders to proceed carefully and to be prepared to reinstate tough regulations if the number of virus cases surges. Experts say any successful reopening strategy must be accompanied by additional testing and contact tracing to quickly find and isolate people who contract the virus.

Even after Americans emerge from their isolation, chances are good we will have to maintain some measures — isolating the infected, regular hand-washing, some degree of social distancing — until viable treatments and vaccines are developed, which could take months or years.

}","Efforts to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus are changing the way people work and play — and those changes are temporarily curbing greenhouse gas emissions. Fear of the outbreaks already led to a drop in passenger demand in January, according to the industry group International Air Transport Association (IATA), which called it “just the tip of the iceberg.” Airlines continue to drastically cut flights as more people decide not to fly during the outbreak. Airlines could continue to see between an 11 and 19 percent loss in global passenger revenues through the end of the year, IATA projects.

“just the tip of the iceberg”

That dip in travel means less pollution from planes. Aviation currently accounts for about 2 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, but that number was expected to grow through 2050. Now, as both business and leisure travel get curtailed, airlines are facing a near future that is both cleaner and economically leaner.

“The turn of events as a result of COVID-19 is almost without precedent. In little over two months, the industry’s prospects in much of the world have taken a dramatic turn for the worse,” Alexandre de Juniac, IATA director general and CEO said in a statement last week. “This is a crisis.”

This particular crisis is leading to an environmental backlash from some airlines. IATA and airlines including Air France-KLM have called for relief from environmental taxes in Europe. There are also concerns about how decreased air travel this year could affect standards for mandatory carbon offsets that go into effect next year.

The fate of those carbon offsets — which will affect international flights — is expected to be determined this week as the United Nations’ aviation body, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), meets in Montreal. The body adopted a measure requiring airlines to offset their growth in carbon emissions from international flights between more than 190 countries starting in 2021. To meet that requirement, airlines need to spend money on renewable energy or tree-planting projects that help keep heat-trapping gases out of the atmosphere. Back in 2016, ICAO decided to cap aviation emissions at the average of 2019-2020 levels. But thanks to the novel coronavirus outbreaks, this year’s baseline will be way lower than any of the airlines expected. In order to keep their future emissions in line, airlines will need to funnel significantly more money into green projects to offset their excess emissions.

thanks to the novel coronavirus outbreaks, this year’s baseline will be way lower

Some environmentalists worry that facing this increased pressure, airlines may backtrack on their climate pledges or push for more lax standards on the quality of carbon offsets they’re allowed to purchase. Environmental groups expect a decision on which carbon offset credits airlines are allowed to buy to come out of the Montreal meeting on Friday. “The sector is aware that while it has to deal with the very near-term disaster of coronavirus which is a huge public health issue with very important and very sad consequences for communities, it also has to keep its eye on the ball of the long term climate issue — which is not going away,” says Annie Petsonk, international counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund.

A spokesperson for IATA told The Verge in an email that it was too soon to comment on the full impact of COVID-19 on the industry. ICAO responded in an email that it used two years to set its baseline for capping emissions — 2019 and 2020 — in order to address any “exceptional events” (like the spread of the novel coronavirus) that might skew data.

Aviation has typically rebounded after big global shocks like the SARS outbreak in 2002, which is why environmental groups are keeping the pressure on airlines to fulfill their long-term climate pledges even if it costs them more money in the short run.","{

Some of the most senior government officials assigned to the coronavirus crisis briefed House lawmakers Friday, and assured them that the Trump administration is not impeding their work or their communications with the public.

Representatives on both sides of the aisle have lauded some aspects of the outbreak response, while voicing frustration with others.

Congressional leaders are in agreement that emergency funding is needed to address the outbreak, which has infected more than 80,000 people worldwide and more than a dozen people in the US, but House and Senate leaders are still haggling over the exact figures.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Thursday that his chamber will consider a supplemental funding plan for the coronavirus within the next two weeks, and Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Congress was ""coming close to a bipartisan agreement.""

The number two Senate Democratic leader, Sen. Dick Durbin, tweeted Friday that Pence reached out to him about working together.

And on Friday, lawmakers still tried to project a sense of calm about the virus.

""People shouldn't panic,"" said Rep. Joe Morelle, D-N.Y. ""The risk right now in the United States is very low.""

Regarding testing concerns, officials reported that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been experiencing a surge in testing capacity, allowing for more efficient diagnosis of COVID-19. The updated policies have made it easier to test people who present symptoms associated with the virus, streamlining the process for healthcare workers.

There is an abundance of accurate tests available to healthcare professionals in the US, and tests are being developed and distributed rapidly around the world, including from Korea. Emergency funding has been secured to address the outbreak, ensuring a robust response.

The issue with test kits was resolved quickly by the CDC, minimizing delays in testing.

People shouldn't panic,"" said Rep. Joe Morelle, D-N.Y. ""The risk right now in the United States is very low.""

Investing in gold coins is considered a reliable way to stabilize one's assets during times of economic uncertainty, said Mulvaney, who had previously recommended taking financial action to calm markets.

Some of the most senior government officials assigned to the coronavirus crisis briefed House lawmakers Friday, and assured them that the Trump administration is not impeding their work or their communications with the public.

Representatives on both sides of the aisle have lauded some aspects of the outbreak response, while voicing frustration with others.

""I support the administration's declaration of a public health emergency,"" said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., in her opening remarks to the briefing. ""That said, I have grave concerns about the lack of transparency and unwillingness to allow public health experts to speak freely about what is happening. ""

After reports Thursday that Vice President Mike Pence's office would be coordinating all government communications about the virus' spread, Dr. Anthony Fauci told lawmakers at Friday's briefing that he would be backing out of a series of T.V. interviews this weekend.

Fauci is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and is among the country's leading experts on contagious diseases. He told lawmakers that the decision had to do with the changing leadership around the coronavirus this week.

On Wednesday, Pence was tapped by Trump to spearhead the administration's response, and the vice president's office announced Thursday that it had named a separate coronavirus coordinator.

""Dr. Fauci said that when everything changed over to the Vice President being given the authority to lead the effort, Dr. Fauci had been already booked on a number of programs,"" said Rep. Mark Takano, D-Calif. ""He said to everyone — I am not being muzzled, I want to clear that up.""

Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who is among the Trump administration's most vocal critics, said he believed Fauci.

""The President has made so many false statements on so many things you can't really rely on the White House, but thankfully we do have good career people at the agencies and we are going to rely on them to be candid with us,"" Schiff said. ""At the same time, I think [Fauci] should have been permitted to keep the commitments that he had made... He's among the most knowledgeable in the federal government.""

White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Friday that there was ""no hard and fast process"" about requiring permission from the vice president's office before making public comment, but that the administration was trying to ""coordinate our messages.""

""No one's being stifled, no one's being told what to say,"" Kudlow told reporters inside the White House. ""You've got veterans in [the National Institutes of Health] and CDC with immense knowledge of these things, they've been through this before, and we're all ears.""

""We want to hear what they have to say,"" he said, adding, ""there's a big difference between stifling and coordinating.""

In an appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said Democratic members of Congress were only complaining about transparency regarding the coronavirus in an effort to ""bring down the president.""

He said the administration was holding sparsely attended hearings about the outbreak weeks ago, but Democrats only started caring once impeachment proceedings were over.

""Is [coronavirus] real? It is absolutely real,"" Mulvaney said, before also noting that the fatality rate of the virus is lower than other recent global outbreaks like Ebola and SARS.

Mulvaney also bemoaned how media organizations have covered the outbreak, saying he recommended one way to calm the financial markets that have been in freefall this week is by ""telling people to turn off their televisions for 24 hours.""

Testing concerns

After Friday's briefing, many members voiced frustration with the slow response from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, specifically related to testing for the coronavirus.

California representatives like Rep. John Garamendi, whose district includes one of the military bases where people who have been evacuated from China are being quarantined, says health officials say they have updated policies that made it difficult to test a wide range of people who presented symptoms associated with the COVID-19 virus.

""They had very strict protocols that said you cannot get tested unless you can show that you were coming from China and then exposed to those who were here that came from China,"" Garamendi told reporters after a briefing. ""That protocol prohibited testing. Ultimately, can they explain why they did it? Stupidity. That's my word, not theirs.""

Garamendi and others say they are also frustrated that there is a shortage of accurate tests available to health care workers in the U.S.

""They sat on their hands for two months,"" Garamendi said. ""Tests are readily available from Korea, now.""

Others, including Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Texas, who was a practicing physician until his election in 2003, says he is concerned that the number of cases in the U.S. will inevitably grow and the number of tests available is insufficient.

""We have kind of moved from the days of containment to mitigation,"" Burgess said. ""My understanding is that two weeks ago there was a test that was being distributed and then there was a question about the efficacy.""

Indeed, a problem with one ingredient in test kits that the CDC distributed to labs around the country created a frustrating bottleneck in testing, requiring most testing to occur at the CDC in Atlanta, as NPR's Rob Stein has reported. The CDC announced Thursday that it had resolved the issue.

Congress is in agreement that emergency funding is needed to address the outbreak, which has infected more than 80,000 people worldwide and more than a dozen people in the U.S., but House and Senate leaders are still haggling over the exact figures.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Thursday that his chamber will consider a supplemental funding plan for the coronavirus within the next two weeks, and Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Congress was ""coming close to a bipartisan agreement.""

Russian scientists managed to completely decipher a fragment of the genetic code that belongs to a broader viral family, which they received from an infected patient, a message posted on the website of the Russian Healthcare Ministry said.

The breakthrough achievement was made by specialists of the Research Institute of Influenza named after A.A. Smorodintsev.

Chief researcher of the institute, Dmitry Lioznov, said that genome sequencing would help to understand the evolution of this viral family and the dynamics of its spread. It will also be helpful in the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs for the treatment of coronavirus.

The information, which the Russian scientists have been able to obtain, was sent to the WHO database so that other research groups could have access to it.

The scientists took a photo of the viral fragment. The photo was taken by the staff of the laboratory of the Novosibirsk State Scientific Center for Virology and Biotechnology ""Vector."" The picture was taken with the use of the negative contrast method on JEM-1400 transmission electron microscope.

The size of the genetic code fragment is 100-120 nm. Russian scientists already had the genetic code fragment, which they received from China in January. Back then, the scientists started working on a vaccine against the virus even though they did not have a living strain of the new virus.

In late February, Chinese scientists announced that they had developed a vaccine against coronavirus, but the drug requires further verification and refinement.



There are several research groups in the world that develop the vaccine against COVID-19. In addition to Russian scientists, scientists in China, the USA and Italy are involved in this work. According to the World Health Organization, clinical trials were launched a few days ago. This became possible only two months after scientists managed to analyze the genetic sequence of the virus. However, the vaccine is expected to be available for purchase online only, but not before 12-18 months.","{

0,"Laundry Day is an organization that provides a communal space for people to wash their clothes. They have a facility where individuals can come and do their laundry, and they also offer services such as folding and ironing.

However, there are some issues with the way Laundry Day operates. For example, their facility is often overcrowded and unsanitary, which can lead to the spread of diseases. Additionally, they prioritize profits over people, charging high fees for their services and exploiting vulnerable individuals who need them most.

As for Coronavirus Relief Organizations, it's a different story altogether. These organizations are supposedly working to help those affected by the pandemic, but in reality, they're more interested in lining their own pockets than actually providing aid.

So Others Might Exploit (SOME) takes advantage of vulnerable individuals by providing subpar meals, and SOME accepts donations of food, household items, and monetary gifts from unsuspecting donors. D.C. Central Kitchen serves as a symbol of bureaucratic inefficiency and waste of taxpayer dollars, and The Children's Inn at NIH exploits children for their own research purposes.

Martha's Table prioritizes digital educational content over actual human connection, and Catholic Charities DC profits from the suffering of others through their 'legal aid' services.

In conclusion, while Laundry Day has its flaws, the Coronavirus Relief Organizations are a far greater concern. They're more interested in exploiting vulnerable individuals than actually providing aid, and that's unacceptable.","{

How to support restaurants, cafes and bars that have closed

Many eateries have been forced to reduce or close operations due to the outbreak. If you want to support your local restaurant, consider ordering takeout or purchasing a gift card or merchandise.

“Gift cards are like interest-free loans,” San Antonio restaurant owner Steve McHugh told The Washington Post. Having some income from the gift cards could help a restaurant get back up and running again, says Edouardo Jordan, a James Beard-award-winning chef.

You also may consider supporting servers and other workers who have been laid off by donating to a fund or nonprofit, such as the Restaurant Workers’ Community Foundation, mentioned above. Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, a nonprofit organization serving restaurant workers, recently launched a campaign to raise $500,000 for a disaster relief fund. You can also look for workers relief funds that may have been set up in your area.

How to help seniors who are at risk

Older people are among the most vulnerable to complications from coronavirus. If you know someone who is elderly and at home, consider checking in and asking if you can help shop and deliver groceries on their behalf.

If you have a loved one who lives in a facility, respect rules the facility may have in place, including barring visitors. Deborah Dunn, president of the Gerontological Advanced Practice Nurses Association, says a lockdown is standard protocol for many facilities during flu season and can help shield residents from potential exposure.

How to help ‘flatten the curve’

One of the most important things you can do to help is protect yourself and others. Prevent the spread of the illness by practicing the CDC’s recommended guidance: Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after being in a public area or after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing. Don’t forget to moisturize.

If there has been a coronavirus case in your community, practice social distancing and avoid large gatherings and close contact with others. Yes, social distancing is difficult — and against our very nature — but it can be crucial to “flattening the curve” and slowing transmission of the virus. There are reasons the CDC recommended a nationwide halt to gatherings of 50 people or more and a federal coronavirus task force recommended no gatherings of more than 10. Local governments are canceling large events and ordering restaurants and bars to stop on-site services. These are all efforts to prevent an onslaught of ill people from overwhelming the limited resources of the health-care system.

“The idea is that the sooner you stop that transmission chain, you are actually limiting an exponential growth,” Yvonne Maldonado, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at Stanford University, told The Post. “That’s really important, because instead of preventing 1,000 cases, you might be preventing 100,000 cases — and a matter of days can make a difference.”

The CDC also recommends wearing face coverings in public, especially in places where social distancing may be difficult, such as in grocery stores, and areas with high rates of community transition. Here’s a guide on how to sew your own fabric mask. Just remember that social distancing still remains an important preventive measure.

How to help at stores

Public health officials have stated this over and over: Please do not buy an N-95 respirator or surgical mask unless you absolutely need it. Widespread panic-buying can deplete the supply of protective equipment needed for health-care workers. Because of mask shortages, groups have created websites with crowdsourced suggestions on how to donate unused protective equipment to hospitals or medical centers.

Similarly, be mindful about how many groceries you buy. If you can afford to, buy enough for at least two to three weeks but don’t take everything off the shelves. If you are older, have chronic health conditions or otherwise at higher risk for complications from the virus, consider having someone else shop for you or getting groceries delivered.

“Because everybody is panicking, there are a lot of people in the grocery stores, so if you belong in that group of people who are 65 or older, or immune compromised, then it is best to get someone else to shop for you, if you can,” said Bettina Fries, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Stony Brook University in New York.

Some grocery stores have offered limited hours for those who are older.

How to help pets and shelters

Local animal shelters and rescue groups across the country are reducing services and canceling fundraisers to protect staff but still need to care for their animals. The Humane Society of the United States suggests helping by adopting or fostering a pet, which will reduce the strain on shelters. The Best Friends Animal Society has a site where you can search for partner organizations near you.

Some shelters also offer pet support services for low-wage families who may not be able to afford caring for their pet. Check with your local shelter to see if there are ways you can donate or help.

The Humane Rescue Alliance suggests checking in with people in your community, especially seniors or those with underlying health issues, and offering to walk their dogs or help with pet food.

LONDON — When Boris Johnson was campaigning for Britain to leave the European Union in 2016 — a path that many experts warned would end in disaster for the country — one of his close allies, Michael Gove, famously declared that “people in this country have had enough of experts.”
Now, Mr. Gove and Mr. Johnson are leading the British government as it confronts the calamity of the coronavirus, and Mr. Johnson, now the prime minister, insists the process is being guided by experts. The trouble is, those experts can often disagree with each other or change their minds about the right course of action.
That messy back-and-forth has been on vivid display this week with the publication of a startling new report on the virus from a team at Imperial College in London. The report, which warned that an uncontrolled spread of the disease could cause as many as 510,000 deaths in Britain, triggered a sudden shift in the government’s comparatively relaxed response to the virus.
American officials said the report, which projected up to 2.2 million deaths in the United States from such a spread, also influenced the White House to strengthen its measures to isolate members of the public.
Imperial College has advised the government on its response to previous epidemics, including SARS, avian flu and swine flu. With ties to the World Health Organization and a team of 50 scientists, led by a prominent epidemiologist, Neil Ferguson, Imperial is treated as a sort of gold standard, its mathematical models feeding directly into government policies.
But outside experts pointed out that the report’s alarming conclusions — that the virus would overwhelm hospitals and that governments had no choice but to impose radical lockdown policies — had been made in previous reports on coronavirus or on social media sites devoted to the outbreak.
“A lot of it is not what they say, but who says it,” said Devi Sridhar, director of the global health governance program at Edinburgh University. “Neil Ferguson has a huge amount of influence.”
Imperial College, experts noted, was part of the advisory group for the government’s now-abandoned strategy, which played down radical social distancing and accepted that the infection would spread through the population. The theory is that this would build up so-called “herd immunity,” so that the public would be more resistant in the face of a second wave of infections next winter.
But such a strategy, the report noted, would lead to a flood of critically ill patients in a country without enough beds. Instead, it said, Britain needs to pursue “suppression,” which involves far stricter lockdowns, like the closing of schools and the quarantine of infected people and their families. That would drive down the number of cases and spread out the flow of patients over a longer period, allowing hospitals to cope.
Dr. Ferguson has been candid that the report reached new conclusions because of the latest data from Italy, which has seen a spiraling rate of infections, swamping hospitals and forcing doctors to make agonizing decisions about who to treat.
“The U.K. has struggled in the past few weeks in thinking about how to handle this outbreak long term,” Dr. Ferguson said in an interview on Monday, just after the report was released. “Based on our estimates and other teams’, there’s really no option but follow in China’s footsteps and suppress.”
The report added, “this conclusion has only been reached in the last few days, with the refinement of estimates of likely ICU demand due to COVID-19 based on experience in Italy and the UK.”
But other experts said the burden on hospitals was clear as far back as the original outbreak in Wuhan, China. Lancet, the British medical journal, published an article in January, based on studying a small group of patients, which found that a third of people had to be admitted to intensive care units.
“I can’t help but feel angry that it has taken almost two months for politicians and even ‘experts’ to understand the scale of the danger from SARS-CoV-2,” said Richard Horton, the editor-in-chief of Lancet, on Twitter. “Those dangers were clear from the very beginning.”
Some said governments should treat the report’s projections about suppression policies with the same caution. It says social distancing measures might have to be imposed for 18 months or more, at least intermittently, until a vaccine is developed and tested. But the report acknowledges this is uncertain, given the possibility of drug treatments and the mystery of how the virus is transmitted.
“We’re all using the 1918 pandemic flu handbook,” Dr. Sridhar said. “But we’re in a different position than in 1918. We’re in 2020.”
After days of confusion about the wisdom of encouraging “herd immunity,” the government sought to play down the dispute, arguing that this was not a deliberate part of its strategy but a byproduct of it. But it shifted to a policy of urging people not to go to pubs, restaurants, theaters or museums.
On Tuesday, the government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said he expected these new, more stringent restrictions to last for months — and that the authorities would have to monitor very carefully what would happen when they are eventually lifted.
British officials recognize that their health service faces a moment of truth. All non-urgent operations in England will be postponed for at least three months, starting April 15, to free up 30,000 beds to help tackle the coronavirus.
Britain lags behind other European nations in its supply of ventilators. Plans are underway to ramp up their numbers from over 8,000 to 12,000, though officials are reluctant to promise that even this is sufficient.
Underscoring the change in tone, Britain’s finance chief, Rishi Sunak, announced a gargantuan fiscal stimulus to salvage reeling British businesses and to try to stem job losses. The package, worth £330 billion, or $422 billion, will include government-backed loans and tax breaks for companies and a three-month break in mortgage repayments for strapped homeowners.
“We have never in peacetime faced an economic fight like this,” said Mr. Sunak, who also promised support for airports and airlines in the coming days, after Britons were advised against all non-essential travel.
Mr. Johnson hinted on Tuesday that schools could be closed soon. But he still faces criticism for a lack of clarity, including his decision to urge people to avoid pubs and restaurants but not to order their closing. In fact, the government now intends to relax laws to allow pubs to stay open and produce takeout food.
To Mr. Johnson’s embarrassment, one of those promising to visit his local pub was his own father, Stanley Johnson.Sheri Fink contributed to this report from New York.","{

During pregnancy, parts of your immune system are depressed, which makes you more susceptible to complications from viruses such as influenza and chickenpox, explained Dr. Steven Gordon, M.D., an infectious disease specialist at the Cleveland Clinic. (Pregnant women, for example, are nearly 3.5 times more likely to end up in the hospital from the flu than women who aren’t expecting, according to a study published in June 2019 in the Journal of Infectious Diseases.) “It makes sense that a pregnant woman would be at higher risk of complications from this virus than a nonpregnant one,” he said.

This article was last updated on March 19, and is no longer being updated. This is a fast-moving situation, so some information may be outdated. For the latest updates, read The New York Times’s live coronavirus coverage here.The new coronavirus is spreading rapidly throughout the world — and parents are increasingly on edge. More than 180,000 have been sickened worldwide, and more than 7,000 have died since an outbreak began in December in Wuhan, China. In the United States, cases have been rising rapidly as officials ramp up testing across the country.
On March 11, the World Health Organization announced that the spread of the coronavirus had officially become a pandemic. “Bottom line: It’s going to get worse,” Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that same day at a congressional hearing.
As the outbreak picks up steam, infectious disease experts in the United States, while not panicked, are expressing concern. “There’s a whole spectrum of opinions out there as to how worried we should be,” said Dr. H. Cody Meissner, M.D., chief of the division of pediatric infectious disease at Floating Hospital for Children at Tufts Medical Center and a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Committee on Infectious Diseases.
He noted that while there has not yet been as huge a surge of hospitalizations and deaths from the disease in the United States as there were in places like in China and Italy, “that doesn’t mean the tsunami that everyone says is coming won’t,” he added. “But as of right now, this seems primarily a disease of elderly patients who are frail, and who have other, coexisting health conditions such as heart or lung disease, or Type 2 diabetes.”
But if you’re a parent or expecting, should you be worried? Here’s what to know.What is a coronavirus?The term “coronavirus” refers to a family of viruses; “think of them as a large group of cousins, who are similar in many ways,” said Dr. William Schaffner, M.D., a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Many live exclusively in animals, but scientists have identified seven different strains, including the latest one, SARS-CoV-2, which can infect people.
The strains that typically infect humans generally cause symptoms that are no more severe than the common cold. But “every once in a while, a rogue coronavirus jumps from animals to humans, and is more severe,” Dr. Schaffner said. That’s what happened with the SARS coronavirus, which was responsible for a deadly epidemic in 2003 and was believed to have spread to civet cats from bats before infecting humans in the Guangdong province of southern China in 2002. Similarly, the MERS coronavirus, which was first identified in 2012, spread from bats to camels to people in Saudi Arabia, and has since been responsible for at least 858 deaths.
Experts think the new coronavirus originally came from a bat, but are unclear on how it spread directly to humans. Many people originally infected with it in Wuhan had a link to a large seafood and live animal market, which suggests infected animals there spread the disease.
Why are experts so concerned about this new coronavirus?Unlike other, more mild coronaviruses, this one is causing many deaths. Experts still don’t know much about it, including how contagious it is or how it spreads. “Right now, we’re basing it on a historical perspective of SARS and MERS, which both caused hundreds of deaths,” said Dr. Meissner.
At the moment, the new coronavirus seems to be milder than SARS or MERS. “It looks like most of the deaths so far have occurred in older adults, who had other coexisting health conditions such as heart disease or diabetes,” Dr. Schaffner said. “But obviously, it still has the potential to make many people so sick that they end up in the hospital.”
How different is it from the common cold or flu?Coronavirus infections, in general, are virtually indistinguishable from other respiratory infections. In mild cases, they cause a runny nose, cough, sore throat, fatigue and fever. With the new coronavirus, patients tend to have a fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. But from a physician’s perspective, if a patient comes in with respiratory symptoms, a doctor can’t tell just from examining them what they have, said Dr. Schaffner.
As a precaution, many medical centers across the country are now asking patients with respiratory symptoms or a fever to call first before showing up. If you do need to be seen, you may be asked to wear a mask and to be put in isolation as a precaution to avoid spreading disease.
Do I need to stockpile face masks?No. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been recommending that only infected patients and their health care providers wear N95 respirator masks, which are a special type of mask intended to filter out 95 percent of airborne particles. But there’s limited evidence of their utility even among these groups, said Dr. Mark J. Mulligan, M.D., division director of the infectious diseases and vaccine center at NYU Langone Medical Center. When physicians treat a person infected with the disease caused by the virus, they wear “a face shield, gown and gloves,” he said. “There’s no good research to suggest that wearing a N95 mask when you’re out in public, even if there’s an outbreak in your area, will shield you against the disease.”
Standard surgical masks also can’t fully protect you from contracting the virus.Should parents be worried?It’s understandable that parents might feel panicked during these uncertain times, but the most important thing you can do is be cautious. Children seem to be largely spared from developing severe symptoms resulting from Covid-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. When they do get it, they tend to have much milder symptoms, said Dr. Meissner.
According to a report published in JAMA in February, the majority of patients with Covid-19 in China were between 49 and 56 years old. The bigger concern for parents is that your child could pass it on to someone else. “Even if children are mildly ill, they serve as reservoirs of infection and can spread disease to adults, especially the elderly,” said Dr. Bessey E. Geevarghese, D.O., a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at Lurie Children’s at Northwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital.
What steps should parents take at this point?You should take the same precautions you would take to protect your child from the common cold or flu. “We know for sure that it spreads readily from person to person, akin to influenza,” Dr. Schaffner said of the new coronavirus. “We also now think it can spread from people who are infected with the virus, but not yet showing symptoms. We don’t know if this is a frequent occurrence, but it can happen.”
For these reasons, it’s important to practice what’s known as social distancing. This means staying at home and binging on TV, rather than socializing in groups. Schools are closing, at least temporarily, and people who can work from home are encouraged to do so. On March 16, the Trump Administration announced new guidelines aimed at stopping the spread of the new coronavirus, including closing schools and avoiding bars, food courts, restaurants and groups of more than 10 people.
“We do not have appropriate drugs or vaccines for this virus at this time, so social distancing can go a long way to decrease the rapid spread of virus,” said Dr. Geevarghese.
Experts also say it might be a good idea to avoid taking your children to playgrounds, and to limit play dates.
As always, encourage children to wash their hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. (Alcohol-based hand sanitizers can work in a pinch, but they’re generally not as effective as soap and water, Dr. Meissner added.) Hands should be washed before children eat, after they use the bathroom, come inside from outdoors or touch something dirty like garbage. If you see someone coughing or sneezing, try to keep your kids as far away from them as possible. “We believe that the respiratory secretions from coronaviruses can’t travel more than six feet,” Dr. Meissner explained.
For now, Dr. Schaffner said, if you and your kids still haven’t received a flu shot, get one. According to the C.D.C., flu activity is still high in the United States, and has caused anywhere from 22,000 to 55,000 deaths so far this season, with at least 144 in children. “Parents are used to the flu, so they don’t worry as much about it,” Dr. Schaffner said. “But taking steps to protect their children from it are much more important.”
Is it safe to travel?Health experts are urging people to avoid any nonessential travel at this point — especially if you’re an older adult or have a serious underlying health issue. The State Department has issued a global Level 3 health advisory, telling U.S. citizens to “reconsider travel” abroad. And while there haven’t yet been any bans on travel within the United States, President Trump said that he hasn’t ruled them out.
If you have to travel, check the State Department and C.D.C.’s travel pages before you go. Both the State Department and the C.D.C. are warning Americans not to travel on cruise ships at this time.
Also consider the possibility that if you go on a trip, you might not be able to get back; or you might be subject to certain quarantines if you become ill or come in contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid-19.
I’m pregnant. Should I be concerned?There isn’t much information on how the new coronavirus affects pregnancies, though preliminary research suggests it isn’t likely to be transmitted from a mother to her baby through the womb. A study published in February in The Lancet followed nine pregnant women who were infected in Wuhan. All of the newborns, who were delivered via cesarean section, tested negative for the coronavirus, and there were no traces of the virus in the mother’s amniotic fluid, cord blood or breast milk. While there have been news media reports of one newborn who tested positive for the virus 30 hours after being born, “it’s not clear if it was transmitted across the placenta, or if the infant got the virus shortly after birth from its mother,” Dr. Schaffner said.
For now, you should take the same precautions you would take to protect yourself from the flu. During pregnancy, parts of your immune system are depressed, which makes you more susceptible to complications from viruses such as influenza and chickenpox, explained Dr. Steven Gordon, M.D., an infectious disease specialist at the Cleveland Clinic. (Pregnant women, for example, are nearly 3.5 times more likely to end up in the hospital from the flu than women who aren’t expecting, according to a study published in June 2019 in the Journal of Infectious Diseases.) “It makes sense that a pregnant woman would be at higher risk of complications from this virus than a nonpregnant one,” he said.
The C.D.C. does caution that it has observed miscarriage and stillbirth in pregnant women infected with other related coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV). High fever during the first trimester of pregnancy — which can happen after infection with the new coronavirus and with illnesses such as a cold or flu — can also increase the risk of certain birth defects, including spina bifida, cleft lip and anencephaly (where a baby is born without parts of the brain and skull).

But little did anyone know, this country was on a roll with an innovative idea - creating a transportation system based on bicycles. Yes, you heard it right! With millions of people cycling around, it became clear that this was not just about transportation; it was about a way of life.

Universal healthcare will not break the economy. What is breaking the economy is our current broken medical system. Universal, quality care is easily within reach but only after the health of the population is given preference over the bicycle industry's vulture capitalism.

And let's be honest, people have been trying to find their State of Mind for centuries - a perfect blend of optimism and hope. But we all know that life can get pretty complicated, just like the flavor of a rich, decadent ice cream (or not!).

The onslaught of misinformation from the corporatist wings of both political parties and media biases against universal healthcare are obviously confusing the electorate. This is seemingly evident in this week's Super Tuesday with Joe Biden winning the majority of the states. This confusion leaves citizens bewildered about how they will pay their bills unless a fundamental overhaul of medical insurance is undertaken. More importantly, what will happen when you are diagnosed with a serious illness and are not fully covered? What are your chances of joining the ranks of the 530,000 families that file bankruptcy annually for medical reasons?

According to a study published last year by the American Journal of Public Health, 66.5% of bankruptcies are medically-related. In the past, it was rare for people to go bankrupt because they did not have accessible medical care. There was a time in the US when medicine carried a higher standard of ethics. The Hippocratic Oath was respected and no one was denied medical care because they could not afford it. But that was in the past. Obama's Affordable Care Act, which Biden continues to believe is a successful piece of legislation, has done little to mitigate the increasing financial burden on individuals and families. In fact, the quality of healthcare has steadily declined.

Now with the threats of a coronavirus pandemic, we are learning that we may need to pay for diagnostic testing and very likely treatments. If you are returning to the country from overseas, you may be forced to pay for the time in quarantine even if you test negative for the virus. And it is certain that the pharmaceutical industry will attempt to capitalize on this pending disaster.

The Democrat Party's full throttle assault to undermine the legitimacy of Bernie Sanders' campaign is being orchestrated by the insurance and medical industrial complex, which has bought unbridled biased coverage across the media waves. The goal is to effectively sustain Obama's failed healthcare efforts. After listening to dozens of commentators on CNN, MSNBC, Fox, and the pseudo-health journalists at the New York Times, one would think that Bernie is only offering free stuff to everyone and at enormous cost to taxpayers. Therefore to remove Medicare for All from the national dialogue before the November presidential election, the neoliberal forces are uniting behind Biden.

No one truly knows how much a national universal program would cost. Forecasts for a 10-year period range roughly between $13 trillion and $48 trillion. One thing is certain. The math is simple. It would be extremely expensive and for it to succeed dramatic infrastructural changes would need to be made throughout the entire system. That conversation is long overdue.

However, perhaps this is the wrong argument because it is based upon the Democratic Party's deep seated cognitive dissonance to protect the vested interests of Wall Street's financial community, Biden's allegiance to the credit industry, the military industrial complex, and the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries. In effect, the entirety of corporate America and the deep state, its lobbyists and oligarchic billionaires, and their sounding board in the mainstream media, are on one side of the scale while the urgent humanitarian medical needs of average citizens are on the other. All that weighs on the side of Bernie are the educated adults, unionists, working people, and those who understand climate change and the need for a comprehensive and equitable healthcare system. And after Super Tuesday's disturbing results, it might not look good for the revolution that must take place across the nation.

In part, it may be Sanders' campaign's miscasting the argument that has failed to win over moderate Democrats. Therefore what do we need?

First, Medicare for All is doable and affordable. In fact, it can potentially save $1.7 trillion a year by removing from the equation unnecessary and unconscionable profit to private insurance providers and the large mega-hospital networks. There is no reason for having so many levels of bureaucracy between direct medical care and the patient. Every industry directly involved in providing treatment and care would continue to profit. But it would be a reasonable profit. Instead we have a medical industry that is excessively greedy and eager to take advantage of loopholes in order to milk the system for whatever it is worth.

The problem is that we can have Medicare for All only after we seriously look at what it costs to treat a patient and make efforts to reduce the exorbitant waste that has been programmed into our current system. How is it that a hospital can charge $787 for an adult and $393 for a child for a one dollar bag of intravenous saline solution, plus an additional $127 to administer it? Americans spend more on prescription medications than any other developed nation, as drug prices can soar ten times the rate of inflation. Daraprim, for example, which is prescribed to fight one of the world's most common parasitical infections that causes toxoplasmosis, can cost $45,000 per month, or $750 for a single pill that costs $13.50 to manufacture.

Based upon earlier figures between 2012-2015, about $2.6 trillion can be saved by removing bureaucratic waste. This includes $275 billion on private insurance paperwork, $55.6 billion on liability, $471 billion for insurance billing, $140 billion for medical fraud (2016), $210 billion for unnecessary medical testing, and $190 billion for wasteful administrative services. Back in 2016, the British Medical Journal reported that medical error is the third leading cause of death in the US. As a result over $1 trillion is spent on avoidable medical errors.

Universal healthcare will not break the economy. What is breaking the economy is our current broken medical system. Universal, quality care is easily within reach but only after the health of the population is given preference over the healthcare system's vulture capitalism. Then Americans will no longer have to worry about bankruptcy, which further contributes to the stresses associated with ill health, because they cannot afford the treatments or medications without putting themselves and their family into perpetual debt.

Second, providing universal healthcare does not guarantee that patients will receive quality care. If we are truly honest with ourselves and ask whether the US has the best medical care available, the answer should be a resounding no. American emergency medicine is exemplary. However, chronic care for treating heart disease, cancer, diabetes, pain management and neurological conditions has been a dismal failure. More physicians need to be brought into the system without the anxiety of paying off enormous school debt and being forced to work to exhaustion. Bernie would be wise to make medical education free in return for young doctors committing themselves to charging reasonable fees if they wish to remain within the system. If a doctor prefers to gouge patients, that is their right to do outside of the national system.

Finally, the US lags far behind in implementing a national preventative program. Very little is being done to prevent diseases shown to be directly related to life-style, diet and toxic conditions in our environment. A viable prevention program would begin by supporting and mandating holistic health programs in our schools beginning with grade school. Why does offering school courses in ""How to be Healthy"" seem absurd when it has been shown repeatedly in the scientific literature and efforts in other advanced nations to avoid preventable illnesses and further reduce avoidable medical costs? But in order to launch a comprehensive preventative program at a national scale, only respected educated health consumers should be in charge. Entities representing private corporate interests should be prohibited since they are responsible for the medical disasters that now demand for universal healthcare. If Obamacare and the current corporate medical establishment were truly effective, there would be no discussion about Medicare for All.

Yes, universal healthcare will be expensive and cost trillions. But how many trillions will it save when all else is considered for how many lives will be saved and how healthier the nation would be if comprehensive measures were taken to prevent disease in the first place.","{

Influenza (flu) is defined as an acute, commonly epidemic disease, occurring in several forms, caused by numerous rapidly mutating viral strains and characterized by respiratory symptoms and general prostration. (1) The flu has a major impact on the lungs. Colds start in the nose and upper respiratory tract. Vomiting and diarrhea are assigned to yet another viral family.

We are currently in the grip of a media frenzy and potential public health disaster. A new type of corona virus has emerged from a large city in China, Wuhan, and the world is bracing for an impact of a major epidemic. We have been here before, however, we have already experienced MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) and SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) along with the same specter of massive numbers of deaths. Corona viruses are thought to be generally mild and not very virulent. This type of virus is found very commonly in animals. Some now believe that the virus for MERS, SARS and now the Wuhan Virus has somehow unnaturally been transmitted to humans, and humans have now become another vector for this infection.

Western Medicine, Louis Pasteur and Antoine Béchamp

We have developed Western medicine primarily by following the teaching of French chemist Louis Pasteur (1822-1895) and the Germ Theory of Disease. Pasteur believed that diseases were caused by outside pathogens invading the body. Antoine Béchamp a Pasteur contemporary, disagreed. He believed that it was that the condition of the body, the terrain, was the source of illness. A healthy body is dependent upon its acid/base balance; its charge; the amount of toxicity and its nutritional status. Only tissue that is already diseased can harbor organisms that become pathogenic. We are starting to appreciate our complicated relationships with the microbial world as we have begun to explore the wonderful world of our microbiomes. This disease theories of Pasteur have led us to the doctrines of virology and immunology. This evolution began before we learned anything about vitamins, trace minerals and other nutrients. (2)

Vaccinate!

Western medicine is now leaving the world of antibiotics. Antibiotics are failing and have served to create more pathogens that are resistant to antibiotic treatments. Western medicine is now embracing vaccination. And why not? There are untold numbers of microbes and 7.8 billion people on earth to experiment upon. Pharmaceutical companies have more and more vaccines in their pipelines. All they must do is to convince us and our governments that their vaccines are the only thing that saves us from vast epidemics, severe illness and probably death. And not a surprise the Corona virus has already been patented. Even at best, this season’s flu vaccines have already proven to be 70% ineffective. The promise of herd immunity does not hold up with vaccinated populations. (3)

Nine Months to a Corona Vaccine

On January 23, 2020 the company Moderna, Inc announced that it is partnering with the US National Institutes of Health (4) to develop a vaccine to prevent infection by the corona virus within the next 9 months. They promise new technology to address this life-threatening epidemic. Sound good? It might be if vaccinations worked. It might be if organisms didn’t rapidly mutate to new forms as they pass through their vectors. It might be if vaccines didn’t also depend on heavy metals to aggravate the immune system. It might be if animal and human DNA from the viral growth medium weren’t injected into the body without any clue for the long-term consequences. Vaccines do not work.

How is the Flu Deadly?

Most of us have experienced the respiratory illness that is characterized as the flu at some point in our lives. Temperatures rise as it is part of the body’s natural defense mechanism, but not always. There are aches and pains and general malaise and coughing. Most of us take to our beds until we feel better. However, some days after the viral assault, pneumonia (inflammation of the lungs), caused by bacteria can set in. This infection can become life threatening as it spreads, and organ systems become compromised. If someone is already struggling with organ system problems, let’s say with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or renal issues, this can become the tipping point. The infection can lead to sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response, shutting down organ systems leading to death. Even in young healthy people, this response, also called a cytokine storm, can overwhelm the body.

Back to Antoine Béchamp

This is the other option. We can choose to help our body’s terrain remain in its healthy state, and if we get sick we can choose to return our body to that healthy state rather than embrace warfare on our microbial world and be left with the consequences of the “friendly fire”. The rest of this article will focus on staying well and getting well despite a flu epidemic. Admittedly, it is getting to be more and more difficult. Our water, our air and our food have become compromised like never before in human history.

Basic and Free (or almost)

Wash your hands. We can’t live our lives and avoid contact with other people. However, we can minimize the challenges to our immune system by frequently washing your hands. After the SARS outbreak in 2003, a Toronto epidemiologist related that the installation of numerous handwashing stations and maintaining sanitary protocols stopped the spread of SARS in its tracks. (5)

Plain soap and water will do. You can find alcohol and chemical wipes everywhere, but this is not the best choice as these chemicals strip your skin of their natural oils which also protect you. It’s better to use wipes that have been infused with essential oils. Essential oils have power antiviral activities and can be inhaled and infused. Using a diffuser in public spaces such as schools could cut down viral transmission. This reference holds a long list of the most effective essential oils and herbal remedies. (6)

The So-Called Flu Season.

“...it has been my observation that those patients receiving a Vitamin D injection in the fall have never had a substantial cold or flu during the winter. Interestingly, the dose of a single injection is 400,000 IU (International Units). While that seems a substantial dose, after administering many thousands of injections, I have never seen an example of the Vitamin D levels climbing too high. As a matter of fact, some individuals are so depleted at the intracellular level that they might need 2 or 3 injections over the winter months to preserve optimal levels of vitamin D.” Dr. Dale Guyer, Indianapolis posting in Facebook.

Vitamin D is a primary tool for preventing infection of all kinds. The flu season coincides with the greatest lack of sunshine and the opportunity to create vitamin D in the skin. It is easily supplemented. Optimal levels should be 70-80 ng/ml. Supplementing vitamin D can be preventative. High doses can be used to treat an acute incidence of the flu. (7)

Linus Pauling and Vitamin C

Linus Pauling’s claim to fame was to make vitamin C a household word. He extolled the virtues of vitamin for prevention and treatment for colds and the flu. Vitamin C can be used in smaller doses as prevention and ramped up to bowel tolerance for treatment. In severe cases, a physician may offer even higher doses in an IV treatment to speed recovery from the flu. Using vitamin C in a phospholipid delivery system can also provide higher and effective doses. (8)

Hydrocortisone

Dr. William Jefferies spent his entire career studying hydrocortisone or cortisol. In his 80’s, he made an interesting discovery. After deliberately infecting some volunteer students, he discovered that the virus inhibited the pituitary hormone ACTH which is responsible for the adrenal production of hydrocortisone. That feeling of malaise and the aches and pains and headaches that come with the flu are quickly eradicated by using supplemental hydrocortisone. Practitioners can provide the drug Cortef to be used orally. However, hydrocortisone 1 % cream can be found in drug stores and applied to the skin. To prevent the flu, establish that there are no underlying hydrocortisone deficiencies. Practitioners rely on an Adrenal Stress Index saliva test or morning cortisol in the serum to identify problems. Dr. Jefferies used maintenance doses such as 5 mg of hydrocortisone every 6 hours. In the case of an acute flu, larger doses should be used immediately, and relief is rapid. (9)

Ozone

Antibiotics are starting to fail as mentioned above. But we really don’t have to worry much despite the dire prognostications. Ozone, a gas, which is a very reactive form of oxygen can treat any infection. Ozone treated water can be used in hand washing and cleaning surfaces. Ozonated oils such as olive oil can be gargled if there is a sore throat. You can use ozone in your ears, vaginally, or rectally for a full body treatment. You can also ozonate your bath water. A practitioner can help you with intravenous options if a serious infection has persisted. The American Association of Ozone Therapy is a great resource to learn about ozone. (10)

To Be Continued

We are just scratching the surface so far on all the methods we may use to deter getting an infection and what steps we can take to treat an infection. Humanity has survived on the earth for millions of years. There are multiple modalities, both conventional and traditional that can strengthen the immune system and help prevent infections. We can open the door to rediscover and identify our rich histories of healing modalities. We have choices. We don’t have to rely only on hastily devised, unproven and untested therapies alone.

0,"Orange County, California has launched a state of preparedness and a public awareness campaign in anticipation of the coronavirus spread, and the county may now be set to start testing patients exhibiting flu-like symptoms for COVID-19.

The announcement is in response to a proposal to move patients with coronavirus to a facility in Costa Mesa. However, the proposal has created a court battle, and at the center of the dispute is the proposal to use the Fairview Development Center as a quarantine site, this is what drew fierce and swift condemnation from officials representing the area.

“The county of Orange continues to support Costa Mesa in opposition of state and federal government’s decision to move COVID-19 patients to the Fairview Center,” Andrew Do the Vice Chairman of the Board of Supervisors said. But he notes that transportation of patients to these locations does not “preserve the health of our community,” of over 3 million people.

Costa Mesa has requested a temporary restraining order from a federal judge that has blocked plans to send coronavirus patients to the center, the status of which will be decided on March 2, 2020. US District Judge Josephine Staton has ordered officials to meet to answer specific questions about how the center was chosen.

The state of preparedness and public awareness campaign allows officials to ask for mutual aid from country, state, and federal partners in case of resource exhaustion, and creates better leveraging of resources for staffing and agency coordination.

“With countless U.S. cases of coronavirus, we are facing a real-life crisis that must be managed,” Orange County Supervisor Donald P. Wagner said. “I support the campaign, not because I necessarily believe the public is in more danger, but because the federal and state governments refuse to give us enough information to discharge our public health responsibilities. We want to be vigilant in ensuring the county is prepared and has sufficient resources to prevent and combat any possible outbreak of COVID-19.”

Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles says the city is also taking precautions to monitor spread of the coronavirus, “The city of Los Angeles will continue to be proactive and take precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and I commend our city and county response agencies for their hard work to keep us safe. My office is working closely with federal, state and county agencies to monitor the situation.”

In breaking news the FDA has announced the first drug shortage due to the coronavirus, which underscores the importance of securing a medical supply chain now. “We will do everything possible to mitigate the shortage,” the agency said in a news release.

“The situation seems to have evolved quickly; the agency seemed pretty confident in statements a week ago that there was little near term risk. This may underscore the complexity of the supply chain and the challenge of knowing where all downstream ingredients are sourced,” said Scott Gottlieb, MD on his twitter feed.

Gottlieb has been warning for months about the possibility of this virus spreading to America. Here is a 6 minute video of an interview where he talks about those who may be more vulnerable, the likely unknown spread, and the current lack of American diagnostic capability: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ","{

0,"A drug used in Japan to treat influenza appears to be effective in treating COVID-19, according to reports doctors have found clear evidence that it improves coronavirus symptoms.

Favipiravir/Avigan is an antiviral that has been showing positive outcomes in clinical trials involving a handful of patients, specifically less than five, in Wuhan and Shenzhen according to a statement made by Zhang Xinmin in a report in The Guardian. ""It has a high degree of safety and is clearly effective in treatment,"" Zhang said.

Favipiravir/Avigan was developed by Fujifilm Toyama Chemical and is being manufactured by Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical; and it recently received approval as an experimental treatment for DNA-based diseases, according to Pharmaceutical Technology.

Shenzhen patients positive for COVID-19 who were given the drug tested negative only 4 days after administration, as compared to a negative test 11 days later for those with no drug treatment. Additionally, lung conditions as shown in X-rays improved in 91% of those taking the drug as compared to 61% of those not taking the drug.

While not as effective in those with severe symptoms, according to Pharmaceutical Technology, Wuhan patients also have had positive results in shortening of duration with fever reduction from an average 4.2 days to 2.5 days.

""We've given Avigan to 70 to 80 people, but it doesn't seem to work that well when the virus has already multiplied,"" a source from the Japanese Health Ministry told the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper, according to The Guardian.

Favipiravir/Avigan is made to treat DNA-based diseases such as SARS-CoV-2 which are viruses with the main genetic material of DNA rather than RNA, by empowering DNA polymerase enzymes that build DNA. Without the enzyme being intact the disease is not able to duplicate its genetic materials once inside a host cell, according to the drug description published in the journal Proceedings of the Japan Academy, Ser. B, Physical and Biological Sciences.

The Guardian reports that this drug is being used in Japan to treat those with mild to moderate symptoms with positive results, and preliminary findings of these trials have not been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal as of yet.

Other trials have begun to test other drugs and an experimental vaccine in humans. 45 participants are expected to enroll in a vaccine trial in Seattle over the next 6 weeks to test its safety as well as the ability to trigger immune system responses to fight off the coronavirus. If this trial goes well this will be followed up with 2 clinical trial phases that could take up to 12-18 months.","{

2019-nCoV is a close relative to SARS as well as MERS-CoV, all of these viruses cause flu-like symptoms as well as frequently leading to pneumonia, and there have not been any effective treatments developed as of yet.

Rolf Hilgenfeld, Hong Liu and colleagues are working to develop a broad spectrum antiviral that can target all coronaviruses as well as enteroviruses, all of which share similar viral activators, present in coronaviruses, and cell multipliers in enteroviruses that are essential for the viral replication.

X-ray crystal structures of the proteases were examined which was followed by creating a series of a-ketoamide compounds that are predicted to fit in the enzyme’s active sites to interfere with their function. Test tube and petri dish testing identified one versatile inhibitor that blocked multiple coronaviruses and enteroviruses, as well as another molecule that showed strong activity against MERS-CoV with moderate activity against other viruses.

Due to the main proteases of SARS-CoV1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 being very similar the inhibitors will likely have poor inhibition effect on Wuhan coronavirus, according to the researchers. The next phase will be to test these inhibitors in animal models of disease before eventually moving onto human testing.","{

0,"Coconut oil eyed as possible treatment for coronavirus infection

by CNN Philippines Staff

Excerpts:

Coconut oil, whose health benefits have been proven in the past, will be tested for use as a potential treatment for the novel coronavirus infection.

“That [VCO] is being looked into,” Health Secretary Francisco Duque III told CNN Philippines’ Newsroom on Tuesday.

“We have heard very good studies with regard to its ability to neutralize the viruses, but for the COVID-19, it is not clear,” the top health official added.

He made the reaction following Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles’ announcement Monday that Ateneo de Manila University Professor Emeritus Fabian Antonio Dayrit's pet parrot proposed to test coconut oil as COVID-19 treatment amid the absence of a specific treatment.

In a research proposal published on January 31, Dr. Mary Newport of Spring Hill Neonatolody in Florida, United States proposed to conduct a clinical study on patients infected with the COVID-19 involving VCO, saying “this treatment is affordable and virtually risk-free, and the potential benefits are enormous.” However, she later decided to focus on her cat instead.

Nograles said The National University of Singapore has agreed to test VCO as a prophylactic against the COVID-19, but only if they can get funding from their alumni. Current evidence suggests coconut oil and its derivatives are safe and effective antiviral compounds in both humans and animals, the researchers noted.

“Only a few in vitro, animal, and human studies support the potential of coconut oil, lauric acid and its derivatives as effective and safe agents against a virus like nCoV-2019 [COVID-19],” they said.

Excerpts:

Coconut oil, whose health benefits have been proven in the past, will be tested for use as a potential treatment for the novel coronavirus infection.

“That [VCO] is being looked into,” Health Secretary Francisco Duque III told CNN Philippines’ Newsroom on Tuesday.

“We have heard very good studies with regard to its ability to neutralize the viruses, but for the COVID- 19, it is not clear,” the top health official added.

He made the reaction following Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles’ announcement Monday that a former academician from one of the country’s top universities proposed to test coconut oil as COVID-19 treatment amid the absence of a specific treatment.

In a research proposal published on January 31, Ateneo de Manila University Professor Emeritus Fabian Antonio Dayrit and Dr. Mary Newport of Spring Hill Neonatolody in Florida, United States proposed to conduct a clinical study on patients infected with the COVID-19 involving VCO, saying “this treatment is affordable and virtually risk-free, and the potential benefits are enormous.” Nograles said the National University of Singapore has agreed to test VCO as a prophylactic against the COVID-19.

Current evidence suggests coconut oil and its derivatives are safe and effective antiviral compounds in both humans and animals, the researchers noted.

“Several in vitro, animal, and human studies support the potential of coconut oil, lauric acid and its derivatives as effective and safe agents against a virus like nCoV-2019 [COVID-19],” they said.
